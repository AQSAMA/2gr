# VI. RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON REVIEWED EVIDENCE

## A. For Healthcare Policy Makers

### 1. Mental Health System Strengthening

	The evidence reviewed in this paper presents a clear case for large-scale investment in Iraq's mental health infrastructure. With only six specialized psychiatric hospitals serving a population of over 40 million, and a psychiatrist-to-population ratio of 0.34 per 100,000—among the lowest in the MENA region (Saied et al., 2023; Okasha et al., 2025)—the current system cannot meet even a fraction of the demand. Over 20% of Iraqis are estimated to have a mental illness, and that figure continues to rise (Saied et al., 2023). The Iraqi Ministry of Health should prioritize the construction of new psychiatric units within existing general hospitals in underserved governorates, particularly in western and southern Iraq, where conflict exposure has been high and psychiatric services are virtually absent. In parallel, structured residency programs and government scholarships for psychiatry training—similar to those that existed before the Iran-Iraq War (Younis & Khunda, 2020)—should be re-established to rebuild the workforce lost through four decades of brain drain. The experience of the 1950s and 1960s, when these programs increased the psychiatrist ratio from 0.2 to 0.5 per 100,000, demonstrates that targeted investment in human resources can produce measurable gains within a single generation (Younis & Khunda, 2020).

	Beyond workforce expansion, the Iraqi government should develop a national essential psychotropic medications list, ensuring that first-line treatments—including clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia—are consistently available at all public psychiatric facilities. The complete absence of clozapine at Ibn Rushd Psychiatric Teaching Hospital (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026), Iraq's main acute psychiatric facility, represents a gap that forces clinicians to rely on antipsychotic polypharmacy as a substitute, exposing patients to avoidable risks. Subsidizing psychiatric medications and incorporating them into the public health supply chain would address the cost barriers that currently push patients toward cheaper but less appropriate drug choices (Kadhim et al., 2024) and toward faith healers who charge fees that can exceed $1,000 without providing evidence-based treatment (Younis et al., 2020).

### 2. Anti-Stigma Campaigns

	National anti-stigma campaigns in Iraq should be designed around the specific evidence identified in this review rather than imported wholesale from Western models. The Baghdad data show that 83.4% of the public blames people with mental illness for their condition, 43.6% considers them dangerous, and 75.4% would hide their own mental health problems from others (Sadik et al., 2010). Addressing these attitudes requires a sustained, multi-channel approach. The integration model advocated by Almazeedi and Alsuwaidan (2014) for Kuwait offers a practical template: pairing mental health education with community-trusted figures, including religious leaders, physicians, and public personalities, to normalize conversations about psychiatric treatment in settings where Iraqis already feel comfortable—mosques, primary care centres, and universities.

	Religious leaders deserve particular attention as anti-stigma allies. Given that 79.2% of Iraqi refugees endorsed Quranic reading as helpful for mental health (Slewa-Younan et al., 2014) and that 57.9% of psychiatric patients visited faith healers before or alongside professional care (Younis et al., 2020), any campaign that ignores the religious dimension will fail to reach the populations most in need. Rather than opposing faith-based approaches, anti-stigma programs should engage religious leaders as partners—training them to recognize signs of mental illness, encouraging them to refer congregants to professional services, and framing medication acceptance within a spiritual context that resonates with Iraqi cultural values. Booth et al. (2024) emphasized that in conservative communities, culturally relevant and religiously appropriate strategies are not optional but necessary for any mental health reform to gain acceptance.

### 3. Medication Access and Affordability

	The reviewed evidence identifies cost as a tangible barrier to psychiatric medication adherence across all populations studied. In Basra, medical students preferred sedatives and hypnotics partly because they were more available and less expensive (Kadhim et al., 2024). Among Syrian refugees—a population facing economic pressures comparable to those of many internally displaced Iraqis—transportation costs alone were enough to undermine treatment continuity (Dikeç & Timarcıoğlu, 2023). The systematic review by Gast and Mathes (2019) confirmed a "social gradient in adherence," with co-payments having a robust negative effect on medication-taking behavior. These findings, taken together, argue for a policy that subsidizes essential psychotropic medications at the point of care, builds a reliable pharmaceutical supply chain that reaches rural and conflict-affected areas, and promotes generic medication availability to reduce per-unit costs. Since Iraq lacks a universal public health insurance system (Saied et al., 2023), targeted subsidies for psychiatric medications would represent a cost-effective investment, particularly given that non-adherence in schizophrenia alone generates an estimated $10 billion in annual re-hospitalization costs in the United States (Abdul Kareem & Mahmood, 2022)—costs that Iraq, with its constrained budget, can least afford.

## B. For Healthcare Providers

### 1. Pharmacist-Led Interventions

	Pharmacists in Iraq are uniquely positioned to improve psychiatric medication outcomes because they are the healthcare professionals most frequently encountered by patients in community settings. The comprehensive medication management (CMM) model described by Herbert et al. (2020) offers a framework that can be adapted for Iraqi pharmacies. In this model, pharmacists conduct structured medication reviews, identify drug therapy problems, and collaborate with prescribers to optimize treatment plans. When applied to psychiatric medications—where polypharmacy rates reach 47.6% (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026), where patients frequently take medications "on need" rather than regularly (Kadhim et al., 2024), and where 10.7% of students self-medicate with psychotropic drugs—pharmacist-led interventions could address gaps that the current system leaves open.

	Iraqi pharmacy practice should expand to include routine medication counseling for patients receiving psychiatric prescriptions. This counseling should address the specific concerns that drive non-adherence: fears of dependency, confusion about treatment duration, and the belief that medications should be stopped once symptoms improve—a behavior reported by 29.3% of non-adherent patients in comparable settings (Abdisa et al., 2020). The collaborative model described by Van et al. (2012), in which community pharmacists work in partnership with general practitioners through shared care plans and regular communication, provides a structure for this expansion. Their validated Frequency of Collaboration scale and its associated model demonstrated that pharmacists who collaborated more frequently with physicians reported higher professional satisfaction and better patient outcomes—a finding that supports the development of interprofessional psychiatric care pathways in Iraq.

### 2. Physician Education and Rational Prescribing

	The prescribing patterns documented at Ibn Rushd Hospital demand targeted educational intervention. With 35.6% of inpatients receiving high-dose antipsychotic therapy and polypharmacy being the strongest predictor of high dosing (AOR 12.61), the data indicate a pattern of dose escalation through medication combination rather than through evidence-based treatment algorithms (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026). The regional comparison with Qatar, where polypharmacy reached 44.1% and the global median is 19.6% (Ouanes et al., 2020), suggests that this is a MENA-wide issue rather than a uniquely Iraqi one, but it remains a clinical priority.

	Continuing medical education programs for Iraqi psychiatrists and general practitioners should emphasize three areas. First, rational prescribing protocols that follow international guidelines—including the appropriate use of clozapine before resorting to polypharmacy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Second, patient-centered communication techniques that address the necessity-concerns imbalance identified by Horne et al. (1999), where psychiatric patients perceive the lowest necessity and highest concern for their medications compared to any other patient group. Third, training in motivational interviewing and adherence-focused counseling, which Zygmunt et al. (2002) showed to be significantly more effective (55% success rate) than broadly based interventions (26%) for improving medication adherence in schizophrenia.

### 3. Interprofessional Collaboration

	The reviewed evidence consistently supports integrated, team-based care as the most effective model for mental health service delivery in resource-limited settings. Cubillos et al. (2021) reviewed 58 studies across 19 low- and middle-income countries and found that integrating behavioral health into primary care improved depression outcomes in 36 of 42 studies, was cost-effective from a societal perspective, and reduced overall costs through decreased productivity losses. For Iraq, where the specialized psychiatric workforce cannot be expanded quickly, task-shifting approaches—in which trained primary care workers, nurses, and community health workers deliver basic mental health interventions under specialist supervision—offer the most practical path to expanding coverage.

	The integration model should establish clear role definitions for each team member: psychiatrists provide diagnostic oversight and manage complex cases; general practitioners prescribe and monitor first-line medications; pharmacists conduct medication reviews and adherence counseling; and community health workers deliver psychoeducation and follow-up. Regular case conferences, even conducted remotely in areas where specialists cannot travel, would enable coordinated care without requiring each patient to visit a centralized facility. The Kuwaiti pilot program, in which psychiatrists began shared-care clinics with family physicians at five community health centres (Almazeedi & Alsuwaidan, 2014), represents a concrete example of how this model can be launched even within bureaucratic healthcare systems.

## C. For Educational Institutions

### 1. Curriculum Integration

	Mental health content in Iraqi pharmacy and medical school curricula should be expanded to address the specific knowledge gaps identified in this review. Among Basra medical-group students, 7.4% were already using psychotropic medications, 10.7% of users obtained them through self-medication, and most took them irregularly (Kadhim et al., 2024). These patterns suggest that even students training to become healthcare professionals lack sufficient understanding of proper psychotropic medication use. Clinical rotations in psychiatric settings should become a required component of pharmacy education, giving students direct exposure to the realities of medication management, patient counseling, and the challenges of adherence in psychiatric populations.

	Anti-stigma education should be woven into the curriculum rather than treated as an add-on. The moderate stigma levels documented among University of Baghdad students (mean 48.79 on a 28-item scale; Hussein Alwan et al., 2025) indicate that negative attitudes are present even among university-educated young adults. Since psychological well-being and social support were the strongest predictors of reduced stigma in that study, educational programs should combine factual instruction about mental illness with experiential learning—such as patient narratives, clinical encounters, and reflective exercises—that builds empathy alongside knowledge.

### 2. Student Support Services

	The evidence that 60.7% of psychotropic drug users among Basra students developed depression or stress after entering college (Kadhim et al., 2024) and that elevated stress, anxiety, and depression scores were documented among 1,504 students in Iraqi Kurdistan (Mohammed & Memmedova, 2023) points to an unmet need for on-campus mental health services. Iraqi universities should establish confidential counseling services staffed by trained professionals, complemented by peer support programs that reduce the social distance documented across the reviewed studies. Mental Health First Aid training—a brief, evidence-based program that improved PTSD recognition by nearly 20 percentage points among community workers serving Iraqi refugees (Uribe Guajardo et al., 2018)—could be adapted for student peer educators, creating a campus-wide network of first responders who can identify students in distress and guide them toward professional help.

## D. For Future Research

### 1. Priority Research Areas Identified from Literature Gaps

	This review has identified several areas where the evidence base is insufficient to guide clinical practice and policy in Iraq. Longitudinal studies tracking medication adherence over time are needed, as the current evidence relies almost entirely on cross-sectional snapshots that cannot capture the trajectory of treatment engagement. Intervention trials testing stigma reduction strategies in the Iraqi context—rather than extrapolating from Western or Gulf studies—should be prioritized to move the field from description to action. Cost-effectiveness analyses of mental health services, including comparisons between specialized hospital-based care and integrated primary care models, would provide the economic evidence needed to justify budget allocation. Qualitative research exploring the lived experiences of Iraqi patients navigating the mental health system—including their interactions with pharmacists, faith healers, and family members—would add depth that the current quantitative literature lacks. Most importantly, Iraq-specific epidemiological studies with nationally representative samples across all 18 governorates are needed to replace the current reliance on data from Baghdad, Basra, and the Kurdistan Region.

### 2. Methodological Improvements Needed

	Future studies should address the methodological limitations identified throughout this review. Nationally representative sampling that includes rural, semi-urban, and conflict-affected areas is essential, as the current geographic concentration of research in major cities limits the generalizability of findings. Mixed-methods designs that combine quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews would provide both the statistical patterns and the contextual explanations needed for effective policy development. Biomarker validation of medication adherence—rather than relying solely on self-report measures, which Hamrin et al. (2010) showed can overestimate adherence by more than 30 percentage points—should be incorporated into future adherence studies. Standardized instruments validated for the Iraqi cultural context, including Arabic-language versions of tools like the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (Horne et al., 1999) and the General Medication Adherence Scale, would enable meaningful comparisons across Iraqi studies and between Iraq and the broader region. Longitudinal designs that follow patients through the treatment cycle—from initial diagnosis to long-term maintenance—are needed to understand the points at which adherence breaks down and the factors that sustain engagement over time.

# VII. CONCLUSION

## A. Summary of Literature Review Findings

	This literature review has synthesized evidence from 48 sources spanning two decades of scholarship on psychiatric medication use and public acceptance in Iraq and the broader MENA region. The findings converge on a picture of a country where the need for psychiatric care is immense and growing—driven by four decades of successive wars, internal displacement, economic sanctions, and social disruption—while the system's capacity to meet that need remains severely constrained.

	The medication use patterns documented in this review reveal an Iraqi psychiatric system that relies on a narrow range of second-generation antipsychotics, with olanzapine prescribed to 73.3% of inpatients in Baghdad (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026) and polypharmacy rates reaching 47.6%—more than double the global median. The complete absence of clozapine from the Iraqi formulary represents a specific pharmacotherapy gap with direct consequences for the estimated 30% of schizophrenia patients who do not respond to standard antipsychotic therapy. At the student level, psychotropic medication use is shaped as much by affordability and availability as by clinical judgment, with self-medication and irregular use remaining common even among future healthcare professionals (Kadhim et al., 2024).

	Public attitudes toward mental illness in Iraq remain deeply negative. Stigma operates at every level—individual, family, community, and institutional—and functions not merely as a social attitude but as a structural barrier that redirects patients away from evidence-based care and toward faith healers, delays treatment initiation, and undermines adherence once treatment begins. The finding that 57.9% of psychiatric patients visited faith healers, most of them before their first professional consultation (Younis et al., 2020), and that 83.4% of Baghdad residents blamed people with mental illness for their condition (Sadik et al., 2010), shows that stigma in Iraq is not an abstract problem—it has measurable consequences for health-seeking behavior and treatment outcomes.

	Medication adherence is compromised across all populations studied, with non-adherence rates ranging from 39.3% in comparable low-resource settings (Abdisa et al., 2020) to 78.2% among displaced populations (Dikeç & Timarcıoğlu, 2023). The determinants of adherence form a complex web in which self-stigma, economic barriers, side effects, poor insight, and competing explanatory models each play a role. In Iraq, these factors are compounded by the legacy of conflict—a healthcare system that was progressively dismantled by successive wars, a brain drain that reduced the psychiatric workforce to 0.1 per 100,000 at its nadir (Younis & Khunda, 2020), and a population that carries an extraordinary burden of trauma-related mental illness.

## B. Contribution of this Review

	This review makes several contributions to the existing body of knowledge. First, it brings together fragmented evidence on psychiatric medication use in Iraq that has not previously been synthesized in a single work. The Iraqi mental health literature exists in scattered studies from individual hospitals, universities, and cities, and no prior review has attempted to map these findings onto a coherent framework that connects prescribing patterns, public attitudes, adherence determinants, and system-level barriers.

	Second, this review positions the Iraqi evidence within the broader regional and international context, enabling comparisons that highlight both shared MENA patterns—such as high polypharmacy rates and widespread faith healer consultation—and uniquely Iraqi challenges, including the duration and intensity of conflict exposure and the severity of the workforce shortage. Third, the review identifies specific, actionable knowledge gaps that should guide the next generation of Iraqi mental health research, including the need for nationally representative data, longitudinal adherence studies, and intervention trials.

	Fourth, this review emphasizes the role of the pharmacist as a central figure in improving psychiatric medication outcomes in Iraq—a perspective that is underrepresented in the existing literature. The evidence supports pharmacist-led medication management, counseling, and interprofessional collaboration as practical strategies for bridging the gap between what the current psychiatric workforce can provide and what the population needs.

## C. The Path Forward Based on Evidence

	The evidence reviewed here makes clear that Iraq's mental health crisis will not be resolved by any single intervention. The scale of the problem—over 20% of the population affected, fewer than 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000, six psychiatric hospitals for 40 million people, and stigma levels that deter three-quarters of the population from disclosing their own mental health needs—requires a multi-level response that addresses infrastructure, workforce, medication access, stigma, and public education simultaneously (Saied et al., 2023; Sadik et al., 2010; Okasha et al., 2025).

	Yet the evidence also offers grounds for measured optimism. Effective models exist and can be adapted to the Iraqi context. Integrating mental health into primary care has been shown to improve outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (Cubillos et al., 2021). Brief training programs can improve mental health literacy in communities serving Iraqi populations (Uribe Guajardo et al., 2018). Adherence-focused interventions, when properly targeted, produce sustained gains (Zygmunt et al., 2002). Public attitudes, while resistant, are not immutable—the international evidence shows that medication acceptance increases at a rate of approximately 1–1.5% per year when sustained educational efforts are in place (Angermeyer et al., 2017). Even the stigma that currently dominates Iraqi public attitudes can be challenged through culturally grounded approaches that engage religious leaders, integrate mental health into general healthcare, and normalize help-seeking through trusted community channels (Almazeedi & Alsuwaidan, 2014; Booth et al., 2024).

	The pharmacist, positioned at the intersection of medication access and patient contact, has a vital role in this transformation. In a country where psychiatrists are scarce and where pharmacies are among the most accessible healthcare settings, pharmacists can serve as medication counselors, adherence monitors, and mental health educators. The evidence reviewed in this paper supports expanding the pharmacist's role from dispensing to active medication management—a shift that would extend the reach of the psychiatric system without requiring the decade-long investment needed to train new specialists.

## D. Final Reflections

	This review was undertaken as a graduation project by a pharmacy student in Iraq—a country that has lived through more than four decades of war, sanctions, and instability, and where mental health has often been treated as secondary to more visible emergencies. Writing this review has required confronting the gap between what the evidence shows is needed and what is currently available: a gap measured in missing psychiatrists, unavailable medications, and millions of people who suffer in silence because they fear the social consequences of seeking help.

	Yet the very existence of the studies reviewed here—conducted by Iraqi researchers in Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Sulaimani, and Karbala, often under difficult conditions—demonstrates that the knowledge needed to improve the situation is being generated from within Iraq itself. The next generation of Iraqi pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and community health workers has both the responsibility and the opportunity to translate this evidence into practice: to ensure that medications reach the patients who need them, that stigma is challenged through education and engagement, and that no Iraqi citizen is denied effective treatment because of where they live, what they can afford, or what their neighbors might think.

	The path from conflict to recovery is long, but it begins with evidence. This review has attempted to gather that evidence, synthesize it honestly, and point toward the actions it supports. The work of building a mental health system worthy of the Iraqi people—a system that is accessible, affordable, evidence-based, and free from stigma—now passes to those who hold the resources and the authority to act.
