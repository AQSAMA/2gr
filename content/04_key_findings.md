# IV. KEY FINDINGS FROM LITERATURE

## A. Overview of Reviewed Literature

	This review synthesizes findings from 48 sources spanning two decades of scholarship on psychiatric medication use and public acceptance in Iraq and the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Of these, 16 sources report original data collected within Iraq—from cities including Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Karbala, and Sulaimani—covering topics such as prescribing patterns, public perceptions, university student mental health, medication adherence, faith healer consultation, and the impact of conflict on psychiatric services. Eight additional sources address populations in the wider MENA region, including Kuwait, Qatar, Lebanon, and Egypt, as well as Iraqi refugee communities in Australia and Syrian refugees in Turkey. The remaining 24 sources are international in scope, providing systematic reviews, meta-analyses, validated measurement tools, and comparative data that help contextualize the Iraqi findings.

	The publication dates of the reviewed literature reflect growing scholarly attention to mental health in this region. The majority of sources (approximately 55%) were published from 2019 onward, with several key Iraqi studies appearing as recently as 2024 and 2026 (Kadhim et al., 2024; Nassr & Wadeea, 2026; Hussein Alwan et al., 2025). A smaller number of foundational studies from earlier periods were included for their continued relevance—most notably Sadik et al. (2010) on public perceptions of mental health in Iraq, Al-Jawadi and Abdul-Rhman (2007) on childhood mental disorders in Mosul, and Hoge et al. (2004) on combat-related mental health. The study designs represented in this review include cross-sectional surveys, qualitative interviews, retrospective chart reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and narrative literature reviews, allowing the synthesis to draw on both quantitative and qualitative evidence.

## B. Patterns of Psychiatric Medication Use in Iraq and MENA

### 1. Prevalence and Types of Medications

	Evidence on psychotropic medication use in Iraq comes primarily from two populations: university students and psychiatric inpatients. Among medical-group students at the University of Basra, Kadhim et al. (2024) found that 7.4% of 376 surveyed students were using psychotropic medications. The most frequently used drug class among these students was sedatives and hypnotics (46.4%), followed by serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) at 42.9%, tricyclic antidepressants at 21.4%, and atypical antipsychotics at 7.1%. The authors noted that sedatives and hypnotics were preferred because they were more available and less expensive than newer alternatives. The majority of student users (82.1%) obtained their medications through physician or pharmacist guidance, though 10.7% relied on self-medication and 7.1% took drugs based on family or friend advice. Among users, 60.7% took their medication "on need" rather than regularly, and 67.9% reported health improvement after use.

	At the inpatient level, Nassr and Wadeea (2026) conducted a retrospective review of 225 adult psychiatric inpatients at Ibn Rushd Psychiatric Teaching Hospital in Baghdad. The diagnostic profile of the sample was dominated by schizophrenia and psychosis (79.1%), followed by mood disorders (15.6%) and substance-related mental disorders (5.3%). All patients received second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), with olanzapine prescribed in 73.3% of cases and quetiapine in 56.1%. First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) were prescribed to 23.1% of patients, with chlorpromazine being the most common FGA (23.1%), followed by haloperidol (9.8%). Notably, no patients in the study received clozapine—a finding that stands in contrast to international guidelines recommending clozapine for up to 30% of treatment-resistant schizophrenia cases.

	These Iraqi findings can be compared with prescribing data from the Gulf region. In Qatar, Ouanes et al. (2020) examined 537 psychiatric patients and found that SGAs were prescribed to 84.5% of patients, with olanzapine again being the most common agent (45.9%), followed by risperidone (29.1%) and haloperidol (20.3%). Qatar showed a notably higher clozapine use rate of 2.4%, though this remained well below the global mean of 13.6%. The convergence of olanzapine dominance across both Iraqi and Qatari settings suggests a regional prescribing pattern in which a limited number of SGAs dominate clinical practice, while clozapine remains underused relative to evidence-based recommendations.

### 2. Prescribing Patterns and Polypharmacy

	Antipsychotic polypharmacy—the simultaneous use of two or more antipsychotic agents—is a significant finding in the reviewed Iraqi literature. Nassr and Wadeea (2026) reported that 47.6% of inpatients at Ibn Rushd Hospital received multiple antipsychotics: 35.6% received two agents and 12.0% received three. Among those on polypharmacy, the most common combination was olanzapine plus quetiapine (41.1%), followed by olanzapine plus quetiapine plus chlorpromazine (15.9%). The study found that 93.8% of patients receiving high-dose antipsychotic therapy reached that threshold through polypharmacy rather than through high doses of a single agent.

	High-dose antipsychotic therapy itself was identified in 35.6% of the Baghdad sample. Among those receiving high doses, 53.8% were between 100% and 150% of the recommended maximum, 45.0% were between 150% and 200%, and one patient (1.3%) exceeded 200% of the recommended limit. The strongest predictors of high-dose therapy, identified through multivariate logistic regression, were polypharmacy (adjusted odds ratio 12.61, p=0.011) and use of first-generation antipsychotics (AOR 7.05, p=0.022). Demographic factors such as age and sex were not significant predictors.

	The Baghdad polypharmacy rate of 47.6% is comparable to rates observed in other MENA and international settings. In Qatar, Ouanes et al. (2020) reported a polypharmacy rate of 44.1%, with 29.6% on two antipsychotics and 14.6% on three or more. This rate was substantially higher than the global median of 19.6% reported in international meta-analyses (Ouanes et al., 2020). The Qatari study found that psychotic disorder diagnosis (OR 12.22, p=0.002) was the strongest independent predictor of polypharmacy. When considered alongside the Iraqi data, the evidence suggests that antipsychotic polypharmacy in the MENA region exceeds global norms, potentially reflecting limited availability of clozapine, reliance on combination strategies for treatment-resistant cases, and prescribing practices that differ from international guidelines.

	Regarding pediatric populations, international evidence reviewed by Hamrin et al. (2010) showed that psychotropic medication prescribing to children has increased over the past decade due to improved efficacy, fewer side effects, and greater prescriber willingness. Adherence rates in pediatric populations range from 34% to 89%, with studies revealing that parent-reported adherence (89.8%) often substantially overestimates actual physiological adherence (53.5% as confirmed by saliva assays). These patterns, while documented primarily in Western settings, have relevance to Iraq where pediatric mental health services remain in their early stages.

## C. Public Attitudes and Stigma: Findings from Literature

### 1. Stigma Toward Mental Illness in Iraq

	Evidence from Iraqi studies consistently demonstrates that mental health stigma is moderate to high across different population groups. Hussein Alwan et al. (2025) surveyed 300 students at the University of Baghdad and found a mean stigma score of 48.79 (SD=6.811) on a 28-item scale, reflecting moderate stigma levels overall. Regression analysis revealed that psychological factors were the strongest predictor of stigma (Beta=-0.299, p<0.001), followed by social factors (Beta=-0.241, p<0.001). Environmental factors did not reach statistical significance. The study concluded that better psychological well-being and stronger social support had the greatest impact on reducing stigmatizing attitudes among students.

	A broader population-based study by Sadik et al. (2010) surveyed 418 residents across two districts of Baghdad (Karkh and Rasafah) and provided a detailed picture of public perceptions. The findings revealed deeply negative attitudes: 83.4% of respondents believed that people with mental illness are "largely to blame" for their condition, 59.4% considered them identifiable by appearance, 43.6% viewed them as "usually dangerous," and 56.1% said they would be afraid to have a conversation with a mentally ill person. Social distance was high—54.0% said mentally ill people were not capable of true friendship, 48.1% would not marry someone with mental illness, 52.7% believed they should not have children, and 75.4% said they would not want others to know if they themselves suffered from a mental health condition. Regarding perceived causes, approximately 60% of respondents attributed mental illness to brain disease, 67% to substance abuse, 59% to personal weakness, and 30% to God's punishment.

	The Sadik et al. study also highlighted a striking knowledge gap about mental health services: only 15.7% of respondents were aware that information about mental health was available at primary healthcare centres, only 19.2% believed mental health services existed in their community, and only 14.6% thought their local primary care centre provided good mental health care. Education was the only sociodemographic factor significantly associated with social distance (p=0.047), with higher education predicting lower social distance. Age, sex, income, and prior contact with mental illness were not significant predictors.

	Regional comparisons show that this stigma pattern is widespread across the Arab world. A cross-cultural study of 10,036 respondents across 16 Arab countries found that 25% held stigmatizing attitudes and had negative help-seeking attitudes (Booth et al., 2024). In Kuwait, Al-Awadhi et al. (2017) found that even nurses at a general hospital displayed negative attitudes toward patients with mental illness across all four subscales of the Community Attitudes Toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) questionnaire, including authoritarianism (mean 2.85), social restrictiveness (mean 2.97), low benevolence (mean 3.66), and reluctance to accept community mental health ideology (mean 3.48). Cultural beliefs associating mental illness with social shame, curses, and jinn possession were prevalent in the Kuwaiti context, leading many patients to bypass psychiatric services in favor of faith healers.

	In Lebanon, Abi Hana et al. (2022) conducted qualitative interviews with 45 participants across four primary health care centres in Beirut and Mount Lebanon and identified five layers of stigma: structural/systemic stigma, implicit and explicit provider-based stigma, community stigma, family stigma, and self-stigma. Service users reported hiding their psychiatric conditions from partners and family members out of fear of abandonment—in one case, a family member threw a patient's antidepressant medications in the garbage upon discovering them. At the provider level, staff described psychiatric patients as "violent," "burden," and a cause of "crisis incidents," with one general practitioner recommending that patients be "institutionalized, isolated from community." Lebanon's mental health treatment gap exceeds 90%, with only 6% of those needing care identifying stigma as the barrier; the majority (73.8%) simply did not perceive a need for treatment.

### 2. Attitudes Toward Psychiatric Medications

	Beliefs about psychiatric medications differ meaningfully from beliefs about medications for physical conditions. Horne et al. (1999) developed the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and found that psychiatric outpatients had the lowest perceived necessity scores (mean 17.72) compared to diabetic (21.26), asthmatic (19.67), renal (19.45), and cardiac patients (18.76). At the same time, psychiatric patients had significantly higher concern scores (mean 15.60), reflecting fears about dependence, long-term toxicity, and cognitive effects of psychotropic medications. These concerns were inversely associated with medication adherence (ρ=-0.28, p<0.001), while higher necessity beliefs predicted better adherence (ρ=0.19, p<0.01). The researchers estimated that 30–50% of prescribed medications across all conditions are not taken as directed.

	International evidence suggests that public attitudes toward psychiatric medications have been moving in a favorable direction, though significant resistance persists. Mojtabai (2009) analyzed data from the U.S. General Social Survey and found that willingness to take psychiatric medications increased between 1998 and 2006 for depression (41.2% to 49.1%), panic attacks (55.6% to 63.7%), and coping with life stresses (35.5% to 46.6%). However, Black respondents were significantly less willing to use psychiatric medications (AOR=0.54), and those with more education endorsed benefits but were paradoxically less willing to take medications themselves.

	In a systematic review and meta-analysis of population surveys, Angermeyer et al. (2017) found that the public consistently preferred psychotherapy over medication, with 76% recommending psychotherapy for depression compared to 49% for medication. The gap was smaller for schizophrenia, where 85% recommended psychotherapy and 67% recommended medication. Medication recommendations increased over time at a rate of 1.10% per year for depression and 1.45% per year for schizophrenia. However, self-stigma remained a barrier, with 44% of Australian respondents reporting that they would feel embarrassed to see a psychiatrist. These international patterns provide a useful comparison for the Iraqi context, where cultural and religious factors may further amplify medication resistance.

### 3. Mental Health Literacy

	Mental health literacy—defined as knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid in their recognition, management, and prevention—remains limited across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. Elyamani et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review of 27 studies with 16,391 participants across GCC countries and found that fewer than 50% of participants could recognize common mental disorders. In Saudi Arabia, 48% of participants lacked knowledge about bipolar disorder. Half of respondents across the reviewed studies did not believe in medication as treatment for mental illness, preferring instead religious strategies such as prayer and Quranic recitation. The review found that men generally had better knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward mental illness than women, though women showed greater belief in evil spirits and traditional healers as appropriate responses to mental illness. Healthcare professionals paradoxically demonstrated only intermediate-to-limited knowledge despite their training. The review identified no interventional studies in the GCC region, representing a significant research gap.

	Among Iraqi refugees resettled in Australia, Slewa-Younan et al. (2014) found marked deficits in PTSD literacy. Of 225 Iraqi refugees surveyed, only 14.2% correctly identified PTSD from a clinical vignette, compared to 34.3% in the general Australian population. The most common label chosen was "a problem with fear" (41.8%). Despite low recognition, 84.5% viewed a psychiatrist as helpful, and 35.4% selected psychiatrists as the single most helpful provider. Religious approaches ranked highly in the treatment hierarchy: 79.2% viewed reading the Quran or Bible as helpful, and 66.8% endorsed prayer sessions. Notably, 58.0% believed "trying to deal with the problem alone" would be helpful, compared to only 6% in the general Australian population—a nearly tenfold difference that reflects cultural norms of self-reliance. Longer duration of resettlement predicted greater endorsement of professional mental health services, suggesting that acculturation gradually shifts treatment beliefs.

## D. Medication Adherence: Evidence from Studies

### 1. Adherence Patterns in Mental Health Conditions

	Medication non-adherence in psychiatric conditions is pervasive across the reviewed literature. Abdul Kareem and Mahmood (2022), writing from Sulaimani Mental Health Center in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, reviewed the literature on schizophrenia adherence and reported non-adherence rates ranging from 42% to 74%. Their review noted that 25% of patients become non-adherent within 10 days of hospital discharge, 50% within one year, and 75% within two years. The consequences of non-adherence are severe: non-adherent patients face a 3.7-fold higher risk of relapse and a 3.75-fold higher risk of suicide compared to adherent patients. Approximately two-thirds of hospital re-admissions in schizophrenia are attributed to non-adherence, with an estimated annual cost of over $10 billion in the United States alone.

	Among displaced populations, Dikeç and Timarcıoğlu (2023) studied 55 Syrian refugees receiving psychiatric care in southern Turkey and found that 78.2% had poor medication adherence as measured by the General Medication Adherence Scale–Arabic version. The most common medications were antidepressants (63.6%), followed by combined antipsychotic-antidepressant regimens (29.1%) and antipsychotics alone (7.3%). Psychiatric symptom severity showed a significant negative correlation with adherence (r=-0.37, p<0.01)—meaning that patients with more severe symptoms adhered less to their medications, contrary to what might be expected. Male participants had significantly higher adherence scores than females (p<0.001), and a combined model of gender and symptom severity explained 22% of the variance in adherence.

	In Ethiopia, a context that shares some characteristics with Iraq in terms of resource limitations and stigma burden, Abdisa et al. (2020) surveyed 300 psychiatric outpatients at Jimma University Medical Center and found that 39.3% were non-adherent. Among those reporting non-adherence, the most common behaviors were forgetting medication (42.3%), being careless in taking medication (35.3%), stopping when feeling better (29.3%), and stopping when symptoms worsened (17.3%). These patterns are consistent with the international literature, which identifies both intentional and unintentional factors driving non-adherence.

### 2. Barriers to Adherence Identified in Literature

	The barriers to psychiatric medication adherence identified across the reviewed studies fall into five broad categories: stigma-related, economic and access-related, medication-related, patient-related, and system-related.

	Self-stigma has a direct and measurable impact on adherence. Abdisa et al. (2020) found that 28% of psychiatric outpatients had moderate-to-high self-stigma, and multivariate analysis confirmed that medication non-adherence was positively associated with higher self-stigma scores (Beta=0.084, p=0.021). Among non-adherent patients, 28.0% had high stigma levels compared to only 4.9% of adherent patients. The relationship between stigma and specific non-adherence behaviors was also significant: patients with high stigma were more likely to stop medication when they felt worse (51.9% had moderate-to-high stigma) and to be careless in taking medication (47.2% had moderate-to-high stigma).

	Economic and access barriers are particularly relevant in the Iraqi context. Among Syrian refugees in Turkey, Dikeç and Timarcıoğlu (2023) documented culturally negative attitudes toward medication, language barriers with healthcare providers, inability to meet transportation costs, and alternative health-seeking behaviors including consultation with family members and religious leaders before seeking medical treatment. Gast and Mathes (2019), in an updated overview of systematic reviews covering 313 primary studies, identified co-payments as having a robust negative impact on adherence and described a "social gradient in adherence" reflecting broader socioeconomic inequalities. Depression itself was identified as the most robust negative factor, creating a vicious cycle in which the condition being treated actively undermines treatment compliance.

	Medication-related barriers are prominent in the Iraqi review literature. Abdul Kareem and Mahmood (2022) identified side effects (including weight gain, akathisia, and sexual dysfunction), perceived ineffectiveness, complex medication regimens, and concerns about dependency as key medication-related barriers. They noted that 60% of schizophrenia patients have moderate-to-severe impairment of insight, with 25% reporting that they actually miss their psychotic experiences—a finding that directly challenges the assumption that all patients want symptom resolution.

	The beliefs about medicines framework developed by Horne et al. (1999) provides a theoretical basis for understanding medication resistance. The BMQ data showed that patients who hold stronger concerns about medications and weaker beliefs in their necessity are less likely to adhere. People who seek complementary medicine scored significantly higher on general harm beliefs (p<0.05) and general overuse beliefs (p<0.001) compared to those seeking conventional care—a pattern with direct relevance to the Iraqi context where traditional and religious healing approaches remain common alternatives to psychiatric medication.

### 3. Interventions to Improve Adherence

	The evidence on adherence interventions reviewed in this study reveals that no single approach is consistently effective, but certain strategies show promise. A review of 39 intervention studies in schizophrenia found that only 33% reported significant improvement in adherence (Zygmunt et al., 2002). However, when interventions specifically targeted adherence as the primary outcome, the success rate rose to 56%. Short, focused interventions of 4–6 sessions with adherence-specific goals outperformed longer, broader programs, suggesting that intensity alone does not determine effectiveness.

	Behavioral and cognitive approaches showed the strongest evidence. Compliance therapy, which combines motivational interviewing with cognitive techniques to help patients articulate ambivalence about medications, sustained adherence gains over 18 months. Behavioral training that used specific cues, reminders, and self-monitoring tools showed significantly greater adherence at three-month follow-up compared to psychoeducation alone. Family-based behavioral interventions also showed positive results: in one study, approximately 20% of the intervention group was non-adherent at six months compared to 50% in the comparison group.

	Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT) for schizophrenia, evaluated in a meta-analysis of 30 studies with 1,393 patients across nine countries, demonstrated a global effect size of 0.51, with improvements in neurocognition (ES=0.54), psychopathology (ES=0.50), and psychosocial functioning (ES=0.41). The treatment dropout rate was only 14.7%, and benefits increased during follow-up periods (Roder et al., 2006). IPT's low dropout rate is particularly relevant to settings like Iraq, where engagement in mental health treatment is a major challenge.

	Parental factors are central to pediatric medication adherence. Kalaman et al. (2023) reviewed 23 studies involving 77,188 participants and found that family functioning was the most robust predictor of child medication adherence, with dysfunctional families consistently associated with poor adherence. Parental mental health also played a role: maternal and paternal psychiatric hospitalization history was negatively correlated with child adherence (r=-0.31 and r=-0.44, respectively). In one large study of 70,979 children, 63% showed high adherence when their parents were also adherent with their own medications, compared to 53% when parents were non-adherent—demonstrating a modeling effect. Non-adherence rates across the reviewed pediatric studies ranged from 8% to 69%.

## E. War, Conflict, and Mental Health: Literature Review Findings

### 1. Impact of Iraqi Conflicts on Mental Health

	Iraq's successive conflicts have created a mental health burden that is among the most severe in the region. Saied et al. (2023) reported that over 20% of Iraqis have mental illnesses, with prevalence steadily rising due to more than two decades of wars, political instability, and mass displacement. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD are widely observed, particularly among displaced populations. The WHO estimated in 2006 that approximately 10% of the Iraqi population was affected by psychiatric disorders (Younis & Khunda, 2020). Among women in Baghdad, 91.1% have experienced war-related trauma in the past two decades, and young women are more likely to attempt suicide and have suicidal thoughts than men (Saied et al., 2023).

	The historical arc of conflict has been extensively documented. Younis and Khunda (2020) traced the trajectory from the Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988), which resulted in approximately one million casualties and diverted health budgets away from psychiatric services, through the 1991 Gulf War and the subsequent 13-year UN sanctions period that destroyed infrastructure and collapsed the economy—reducing monthly wages to the equivalent of one to two US dollars. The 2003 US-led invasion killed tens of thousands, created a security vacuum, and led to the assassination of 140 doctors including five psychiatrists. Psychiatric outpatient attendees increased from 197,000 in 1990 to 507,000 in 1998 during the sanctions period, reflecting both rising need and deteriorating conditions.

	The mental health impact of combat exposure follows a dose-response pattern. Hoge et al. (2004) surveyed 3,671 US soldiers after deployment to Iraq and found that 15.6–17.1% met screening criteria for major depression, generalized anxiety, or PTSD, compared to a 9.3% pre-deployment baseline. PTSD rates increased linearly with combat exposure: from 4.5% among those with no firefight experience to 19.3% among those who experienced six or more firefights. Among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans more broadly, Berge et al. (2020) reported PTSD prevalence of 12–15.8% and noted that 40–60% of veterans needing treatment do not seek help. Only approximately 13.5% achieved remission after treatment, and treatment dropout rates reached 36% in military populations compared to 18% in civilians.

### 2. Healthcare System Disruption

	The conflicts devastated Iraq's mental health infrastructure. Before the Gulf War, Iraq had approximately 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000 population; by 1998, this had fallen to 0.1 per 100,000 (Younis & Khunda, 2020). In 2001, Iraq had 108 psychiatrists for the entire country; by 2003, this dropped to 90 following the invasion. Although the number recovered to 160 by 2014, the ratio remains critically low at approximately 0.34 psychiatrists per 100,000 population (Saied et al., 2023)—among the lowest in the MENA region. Iraq is one of seven countries in the region with fewer than 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000 (Okasha et al., 2025). Other indicators are equally concerning: in 1998, Iraq had only 0.1 psychiatric nurses per 100,000 and 0.02 psychologists or social workers per 100,000 population.

	The current system operates with only six specialized psychiatric hospitals in the entire country—two in Baghdad and four in the Kurdistan Region—and these facilities "do not even meet the bare minimum of demand" (Saied et al., 2023). The country has no stand-alone or integrated strategies for suicide prevention, child mental health, or adolescent mental health, and no public health insurance system covers the entire population. Mental health legislation was passed in 2005 but has not been used to its full potential.

	The systemic shortages have driven growing interest in integrating mental health services into primary care. Cubillos et al. (2021) reviewed 58 studies across 19 low- and middle-income countries and found that integrated care models led to greater reduction in depression severity in 36 of 42 studies compared to standard care. While integration increased direct healthcare costs, it was deemed cost-effective from a healthcare perspective and actually reduced overall costs from a societal perspective through decreased patient time costs and fewer productivity losses. The treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries, including Iraq, reaches up to 90%—meaning that the vast majority of individuals with mental illness receive no treatment at all.

## F. Special Populations: Findings from Literature

### 1. Women's Mental Health in Iraq

	Iraqi women carry a disproportionate mental health burden shaped by conflict, displacement, gender-based violence, and systematic socioeconomic disadvantage. The mortality rate among women aged 15–59 more than doubled from 0.83 per 1,000 before March 2003 to 1.95 per 1,000 in the post-invasion period (Younis & Lafta, 2021). An estimated 900,000 widows—representing 9% of Iraq's female population—have been created by the successive wars, but only 86,000 of these widows receive a state pension. Female illiteracy stands at 76.7%, compared to 45.1% for men, and 1.5 million Iraqis have been internally displaced while 2.5 million have been forced into exile (Younis, 2015).

	The mental health data on Iraqi women are striking. The major depressive disorder male-to-female ratio is 1:2.8, and anxiety disorder prevalence is 14.09% among females compared to 9.11% among males (Younis & Lafta, 2021). PTSD prevalence among women reached 14.09% compared to 3.95% among men during peak violence years, and among girls aged 10–15, PTSD prevalence was 13.8% compared to 7.8% among boys (Al-Jawadi & Abdul-Rhman, 2007). Among internally displaced women in makeshift settlements, 61% reported sadness and despair, with suicidal thoughts documented. Pregnant women showed 55% psychiatric morbidity, including anxiety (43.7%), depression (14.6%), and psychological trauma (9.9%), while 33.5% of new mothers showed postnatal depressive symptoms.

	Depression among specific female populations has received focused attention. Al-Asadi and Hussein (2015) studied 251 infertile women attending an infertility unit in Basrah and found a depression prevalence of 68.9%, with 42.2% experiencing mild, 50.3% moderate, and 7.5% severe depression. Independent risk factors included the husband's threat of remarriage (OR 2.61, p=0.018), primary infertility (OR 2.11, p=0.010), infertility duration exceeding five years (OR 1.92, p=0.021), and treatment duration exceeding three years (OR 1.91, p=0.023). These findings illustrate how the intersection of reproductive expectations, marital pressure, and inadequate mental health services compounds psychological distress among Iraqi women.

	The experience of Yazidi women and girls who survived enslavement and genocide represents the most extreme expression of conflict-related trauma. Ibrahim et al. (2018) studied 416 Yazidi women and found that 98.5% of formerly enslaved women met criteria for PTSD (using a cutoff score of 33), compared to 88.9% of non-enslaved women in the same community. Among the formerly enslaved, 100% met criteria when a culturally validated lower cutoff was applied. The mean PTSD score for formerly enslaved women was 61.5 compared to 47.5 for non-enslaved women (p<0.001), and depression scores followed the same pattern (45.3 vs. 35.7, p<0.001). Social rejection mediated the relationship between enslavement experiences and depression, with 44.6% of formerly enslaved women feeling extremely excluded by community members and 49.2% worrying about others' judgment. Only 18.5% of the study population had received any psychosocial support.

### 2. Students and Young Adults

	Iraqi university students experience significant mental health challenges that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mohammed and Memmedova (2023) surveyed 1,504 students across three universities in Iraqi Kurdistan during the pandemic and reported elevated mean scores for stress (3.08 on a 5-point scale), anxiety (2.95), depression (2.91), sleep disorders (2.91), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (2.81). Females scored significantly higher than males on OCD symptoms (p=0.031), and older students (aged 20–21) showed higher depression and OCD scores than younger peers.

	The Basra student study by Kadhim et al. (2024) revealed that psychotropic drug use was significantly associated with several demographic and academic factors. Students older than 20 were overrepresented among drug users (85.7% vs. 14.3% of younger students, p=0.001), as were females (89.3% of users vs. 10.7% males). Depression or stress after entering college was the strongest associated factor: 60.7% of drug users reported developing depression or stress after beginning their university studies, compared to 26.1% of non-users (p=0.001). Being unsatisfied with studies (32.1% of users vs. 11.5% of non-users, p=0.002) and studying in a college outside one's home governorate (35.7% vs. 14.9%, p=0.004) were also significantly associated with psychotropic drug use.

	Stigma among young adults is also documented. The University of Baghdad study by Hussein Alwan et al. (2025) found moderate stigma levels (mean 48.79) among 300 students and concluded that comprehensive mental health promotion strategies incorporating physical, psychological, and social components are needed to reduce stigma in university settings. The study noted that social and cultural considerations deter students from seeking professional help, even when services are available.

### 3. Children and Adolescents

	Al-Jawadi and Abdul-Rhman (2007) conducted a landmark study of 3,079 children aged 1–15 attending primary health care centres in Mosul during 2003–2004, just after the US invasion. The overall prevalence of mental disorders was 37.4%, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.22:1. PTSD was the most common disorder at 10.5%, followed by enuresis (6.0%), separation anxiety disorder (4.3%), specific phobia (3.3%), and stuttering (3.2%). Prevalence increased with age—29.1% among children aged 1–4, 34.9% among those aged 5–9, and 49.2% among those aged 10–15—suggesting a cumulative effect of exposure to conflict-related trauma. Comorbidity was common, with 29.9% of affected children having two disorders and 8.0% having more than two. Among the most prevalent comorbidity patterns, 24.4% of children with two disorders had PTSD combined with enuresis.

	International evidence on pediatric psychotropic medication highlights concerning patterns relevant to the Iraqi context. Hamrin et al. (2010) found that while 7.8% of children aged 4–17 have a lifetime ADHD diagnosis, only 4.3% receive medication treatment. Parental attitudes significantly influence pediatric medication use: 69% of parents believed antipsychotics cause addiction, 75% believed antidepressants cause addiction, and 79.7% feared psychiatric medication in general. Among children themselves, 65% tried to avoid taking their medication and only 32% were willing to tell peers about their medication—reflecting how stigma operates even among young people.

	Military children also showed rising mental health needs. Hisle-Gorman et al. (2019) analyzed data from 1,798,530 military-dependent children and found that diagnosed mental health conditions increased from 9.2% in 2003 to 15.2% in 2015. The most alarming finding was a 53-fold increase in suicidal ideation diagnoses (0.01% to 0.53%) over the study period. Psychotropic medication prescription rates increased from 7.1% to 10.4% during the same period. These findings, while drawn from the US military system, have relevance to Iraqi children exposed to protracted conflict.

### 4. Iraqi Refugees and Displaced Populations

	Mental health among Iraqi refugees is characterized by high trauma exposure, limited mental health literacy, and complex treatment-seeking patterns. Slewa-Younan et al. (2014) found that 31.1% of 225 Iraqi refugees in Australia met the threshold for clinically significant PTSD, and 39.5% had severe psychological distress—compared to only 2.6% in the general Australian population. Despite this burden, only 14.2% could correctly identify PTSD from a clinical vignette, and 58.0% believed that trying to deal with the problem alone would be helpful. Religious approaches (reading the Quran or Bible, prayer) were endorsed as helpful by 79.2% and 66.8% respectively, while traditional therapies were considered harmful by 37.2%.

	Uribe Guajardo et al. (2018) evaluated a 7-hour Mental Health Literacy training course for community-based workers supporting Iraqi refugees and found significant improvements in PTSD recognition (56.9% to 76.5%, p=0.032) and reduction in social distance toward people with mental health problems (p<0.001). Confidence in helping people with mental health problems also increased significantly (Cohen's d=0.73 for PTSD, 0.80 for depression). These results suggest that brief, culturally adapted educational interventions can meaningfully improve mental health responses in refugee-serving communities.

	Among Syrian refugees in Turkey, Dikeç and Timarcıoğlu (2023) documented that 78.2% had poor psychotropic medication adherence. The most common diagnoses were anxiety disorders (45.5%), mood disorders (20.0%), and trauma-related disorders (16.4%). The mean duration of living with a mental disorder was 63.16 months, yet only 3.6% had ever been hospitalized for psychiatric treatment, indicating that the vast majority received only outpatient or intermittent care despite prolonged illness.

## G. Healthcare System Challenges: Evidence from Literature

### 1. Structure and Capacity of Mental Health Services

	Iraq's mental health system operates under severe resource constraints. With approximately 0.34 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, the country is among the most understaffed in the MENA region (Saied et al., 2023). Only six specialized psychiatric hospitals serve the entire population, and the mental health workforce includes critically low numbers of psychiatric nurses and psychologists (Younis & Khunda, 2020). Okasha et al. (2025) placed Iraq among seven countries in the MENA region with fewer than 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000, alongside Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The review noted that while some MENA countries such as Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait have higher psychiatrist numbers, the overall region experiences a severe shortage of mental health professionals relative to the disease burden.

	The integration of mental health into primary care remains limited. Sadik et al. (2010) documented that the primary healthcare ratio in Iraq was 40 health workers and 4 general practitioners per 35,000 population, compared to the UK ratio of 1 GP per 1,700 population. Only 6.12% of those who needed mental health treatment in Iraq actually received care—a treatment gap consistent with the 90% gap documented across low- and middle-income countries (Cubillos et al., 2021). Almazeedi and Alsuwaidan (2014) argued that integrating mental health into general health services in Kuwait could serve as a cost-effective solution that simultaneously reduces stigma by normalizing mental health care within broader healthcare settings.

### 2. Faith Healers and Traditional Medicine

	Faith healers play a significant role in Iraq's mental health context, often serving as the first or primary source of care. Younis et al. (2020) surveyed 482 psychiatric patients in Iraq and found that 57.9% had visited a faith healer at some point—73.1% before their first psychiatric consultation, 23.0% during psychiatric treatment, and 3.9% both before and during. Among those who visited faith healers, the most common interventions were mascots and amulets (55.2%), Quranic verses and prayer (49.8%), herbal remedies (29.7%), physical exorcism including beating (13.6%), stabbing or cautery (8.2%), and sexual abuse or harassment (3.6%). The financial cost was substantial: 77.1% paid fees, with 39.5% paying between $100 and $1,000 and 11.6% paying over $1,000. Despite these experiences, 36.9% of patients still considered faith healer treatment acceptable, and only 30.9% recognized it as useless.

	Education was the strongest predictor of faith healer consultation—patients with higher education were significantly less likely to consult faith healers (p<0.001). Psychiatric diagnosis also mattered: patients with schizophrenia, psychosis, and bipolar disorder were more likely to have visited faith healers than those with depression or anxiety (p=0.02). These patterns align with lay beliefs about mental illness causation identified in the broader literature. Adewuya and Makanjuola (2008), studying 2,078 participants in Nigeria, found that 65.5% attributed mental illness to witchcraft, sorcery, or evil spirits, and 50.1% to God's will or divine punishment. While their study was conducted in a different cultural context, the prevalence of supernatural causal attributions mirrors findings from GCC states where both men and women link emotional and mental issues with religious and social beliefs (Elyamani et al., 2021).

### 3. Substance Use Comorbidity

	Substance use in Iraq creates additional complexity for mental health treatment. Al-Hemiary et al. (2014) reported lifetime prevalence rates of 17.8% for alcohol and 7.02% for drug use in Baghdad. The most commonly used substances were alcohol, hashish, and diverted prescription medications—including benzodiazepines, benzhexol (Artane), and codeine. Tramadol emerged as a substance of increasing concern, particularly in Mosul, where 15.6% of 122 surveyed users injected the drug, and 30.2% used it for psychological well-being rather than pain management. Amphetamine-type stimulants, particularly Captagon tablets, appeared in seizure data beginning in 2009 and increased substantially thereafter. Iraq had only one inpatient treatment center (located in Baghdad) at the time of the study, and diverted psychiatric medications were identified as a source of substance use disorder throughout the country—creating a paradox in which the very medications intended to treat mental illness become substances of abuse when diverted from their intended use.

## H. Healthcare Provider Perspectives: Findings from Literature

### 1. Provider Attitudes Toward Mental Illness

	Healthcare providers are not immune to the stigma that pervades public attitudes toward mental illness. Al-Awadhi et al. (2017) surveyed 308 nurses at a general hospital in Kuwait and found negative attitudes across all four domains of the CAMI questionnaire, with high authoritarianism and social restrictiveness and low benevolence and community mental health ideology scores. Importantly, 85% of the sample were non-Arab (from India, Philippines, Indonesia, and Pakistan), suggesting that mental health stigma among healthcare workers transcends cultural boundaries. Prior personal experience with mental health services was the only factor significantly associated with more positive attitudes (p<0.031), while gender, age, educational level, nationality, and years of work experience showed no significant effect.

	In conservative communities, the challenge is compounded. Booth et al. (2024) found that in Saudi Arabia, approximately half of specialist doctors held stigmatizing views toward people with mental illness, despite their medical training. The general population showed skepticism about mental health screening programs, with beliefs that such programs are only for "insanity." In collectivist Arab societies, mental health stigma extends beyond the individual to affect the entire family's reputation, and patriarchal norms influence health-seeking decisions, particularly for women.

### 2. Pharmacists' Role in Mental Healthcare

	The pharmacist's role in mental health care, while expanding in some international contexts, remains underdeveloped in Iraq. Albaroodi (2019) surveyed 129 pharmacists in Karbala and found relatively poor knowledge regarding proper drug disposal methods—63.6% identified education as the main barrier to implementing medication take-back programs in Iraq, and 85.3% agreed that educational courses could improve their knowledge. While the study focused on drug disposal rather than mental health specifically, it highlights the broader knowledge gaps among Iraqi pharmacists that affect all areas of medication management.

	International evidence demonstrates the potential for pharmacists to play a larger role. Van et al. (2012) found that pharmacist-physician collaboration was driven by interactional factors such as communication, mutual trust, and respect, with pre-registration training contact being a significant predictor of later collaborative practice (p<0.001). Herbert et al. (2020) described a comprehensive medication management program in which pharmacists conducted 1,031 patient encounters across 61 independent pharmacies during a four-month pilot, identifying drug therapy problems and addressing medication adherence barriers. These models, while developed in Western settings, illustrate the type of pharmacy-based mental health support that could be adapted for Iraq, where pharmacists are often the most accessible healthcare providers and already serve as the first point of contact for many patients seeking medications.
