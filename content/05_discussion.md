# V. DISCUSSION

## A. Synthesis and Interpretation of Literature Findings

### 1. Medication Use Patterns in Iraqi Context

	The findings presented in this review reveal prescribing patterns in Iraq that reflect both regional trends and uniquely Iraqi challenges. The dominance of olanzapine in Iraqi psychiatric inpatient settings—prescribed to 73.3% of patients at Ibn Rushd Hospital (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026)—mirrors the pattern observed in Qatar, where olanzapine was prescribed to 45.9% of patients (Ouanes et al., 2020). This convergence suggests that a narrow range of second-generation antipsychotics dominates psychiatric practice across the MENA region, likely driven by medication availability, cost considerations, and prescriber familiarity rather than individualized treatment selection. The near-total absence of clozapine in the Iraqi sample (0%) compared to Qatar's low but existing 2.4% rate and the global mean of 13.6% (Ouanes et al., 2020) points to a specific gap in Iraqi pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia—a gap with direct clinical consequences for the estimated 30% of schizophrenia patients who do not respond to standard antipsychotic therapy.

	These medication patterns must be interpreted within the broader context of Iraq's healthcare system. The country's severe psychiatrist shortage—0.34 per 100,000 population (Saied et al., 2023)—means that a small number of prescribers serve a large and growing patient population. Under these conditions, reliance on a limited set of medications is a practical outcome: prescribers work with what is available and what they know best. Okasha et al. (2025) placed Iraq among seven MENA countries with fewer than 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000, alongside conflict-affected states like Libya, Syria, and Yemen. This grouping is not coincidental; it reflects the well-documented link between armed conflict, brain drain, and the erosion of specialized medical capacity (Younis & Khunda, 2020).

	At the student population level, the Basra data (Kadhim et al., 2024) reveal a different but equally telling pattern. Among medical-group students using psychotropic medications, sedatives and hypnotics were the most common class (46.4%), largely because they were more available and less expensive. The fact that 10.7% of student users relied on self-medication and 7.1% took medications based on family advice—rather than professional guidance—shows that informal medication pathways remain active even among educated young Iraqis. When considered alongside the finding that 60.7% of student users took their medications "on need" rather than regularly, the picture that emerges is one in which medication use is shaped as much by access and affordability as by clinical judgment.

### 2. Stigma as a Central Barrier: Evidence Synthesis

	Across the reviewed literature, stigma emerges consistently as the most significant barrier to psychiatric medication acceptance in Iraq. The findings from multiple studies, when considered together, reveal a multi-layered stigma system that operates at the individual, family, community, and institutional levels—each layer reinforcing the others and collectively reducing the likelihood that an Iraqi citizen with a mental health condition will seek or accept pharmacological treatment.

	The Iraqi-specific evidence is striking in its consistency. In Baghdad, 83.4% of the general public believed that people with mental illness are "largely to blame" for their condition, 43.6% viewed them as "usually dangerous," and 75.4% said they would not want others to know if they themselves had a mental health problem (Sadik et al., 2010). Among university students in Baghdad, moderate stigma levels persisted despite higher education, with psychological well-being and social support being the strongest predictors of reduced stigma (Hussein Alwan et al., 2025). These findings, drawn from different time points and different populations within the same city, suggest that stigma in Iraq is deeply embedded rather than a product of any single factor.

	What makes the Iraqi stigma pattern distinctive, however, is its connection to treatment-seeking behavior. When Younis et al. (2020) found that 57.9% of psychiatric patients had visited a faith healer—73.1% of them before their first psychiatric consultation—the data showed that stigma does not merely discourage treatment; it actively redirects people toward alternative care systems. This redirection carries real costs: 77.1% of faith healer visitors paid fees, with 11.6% paying over $1,000, and some were subjected to physical abuse (13.6% experienced beating, 8.2% stabbing or cautery). The evidence reviewed here thus shows that stigma in Iraq is not just an attitude problem—it is a structural feature of the healthcare system that diverts patients, delays treatment, and exposes vulnerable individuals to harm.

	Regional comparisons confirm that this stigma pattern is widespread but not uniform across the Arab world. The Booth et al. (2024) cross-cultural study found that one in four respondents across 16 Arab countries held stigmatizing attitudes, while Abi Hana et al. (2022) identified five distinct layers of stigma operating within Lebanese primary health care centres. In Kuwait, even nurses displayed negative attitudes toward mental illness patients across all measured domains (Al-Awadhi et al., 2017). However, the magnitude of negative attitudes documented in Iraq by Sadik et al. (2010)—particularly the 83.4% blame attribution and 56.1% fear of conversation—appears to exceed the levels reported in most regional studies, possibly reflecting the compounding effect of decades of conflict and institutional collapse on public attitudes.

	The theoretical framework developed by Horne et al. (1999) helps explain the mechanism through which stigma translates into medication resistance. Their Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire data showed that psychiatric patients had the lowest perceived necessity for their medications (mean 17.72) and the highest concern scores (mean 15.60) compared to patients with diabetes, asthma, renal, and cardiac conditions. The inverse relationship between medication concerns and adherence (ρ=-0.28) and the positive relationship between necessity beliefs and adherence (ρ=0.19) mean that the stigma-driven belief system—which emphasizes the dangers and unnecessity of psychiatric drugs—directly reduces the probability that a patient will take their medication as prescribed.

### 3. Adherence Determinants: Integrating Evidence

	The reviewed literature identifies a complex web of factors influencing psychiatric medication adherence, which can be organized into modifiable and non-modifiable categories. Understanding this distinction is essential for designing effective interventions in the Iraqi context, where resources are limited and efforts must be targeted toward factors that can actually be changed.

	Among modifiable factors, self-stigma stands out as a priority target. Abdisa et al. (2020) demonstrated a direct statistical link between self-stigma and non-adherence: patients with high stigma were more likely to stop medication when feeling worse (51.9% had moderate-to-high stigma) and to be careless about taking medication (47.2%). In the Iraqi context, where public stigma is severe (Sadik et al., 2010) and where social structures amplify individual shame into family-wide consequences (Booth et al., 2024), self-stigma is likely an even more potent driver of non-adherence than the Ethiopian data suggest.

	Beliefs about medicines represent another modifiable factor with strong evidence. The necessity-concerns framework (Horne et al., 1999) predicts that adherence improves when patients perceive their medication as necessary and decreases when concerns about harm outweigh perceived benefits. In Iraq, where 60% of the public attributes mental illness partly to personal weakness and 30% to divine punishment (Sadik et al., 2010), the perceived necessity of pharmacological intervention is likely undermined by competing explanatory models. Patients who believe their condition stems from spiritual causes are less likely to view a chemical intervention as necessary—a pattern confirmed by the finding that patients with schizophrenia and psychosis were significantly more likely to consult faith healers than those with depression or anxiety (Younis et al., 2020).

	Economic and practical barriers, while often considered non-modifiable at the individual level, are highly relevant to Iraqi patients. The broader adherence literature identifies co-payments as having a robust negative impact on adherence and describes a "social gradient in adherence" reflecting socioeconomic inequalities (Gast & Mathes, 2019). In Iraq, where the healthcare system lacks universal public insurance (Saied et al., 2023) and where economic sanctions and conflict have devastated household incomes, the cost of psychiatric medications represents a tangible barrier. The Basra student data showing that sedatives and hypnotics were preferred partly because they were cheaper (Kadhim et al., 2024) illustrate how cost considerations shape medication choices even among relatively educated populations.

	Among non-modifiable factors, the severity of psychiatric illness itself presents a paradox. The Syrian refugee data showed that patients with more severe symptoms adhered less to their medications (r=-0.37), not more (Dikeç & Timarcıoğlu, 2023). Similarly, Abdul Kareem and Mahmood (2022) noted that 60% of schizophrenia patients have moderate-to-severe impairment of insight, with 25% reporting that they actually miss their psychotic experiences. These findings challenge the clinical assumption that sicker patients are more motivated to take their medications and suggest that treatment plans must account for the possibility that the illness itself is the greatest obstacle to its own treatment.

## B. War, Conflict, and Mental Health Treatment: Interpreting the Evidence

### 1. Legacy of Conflict on Mental Healthcare

	The evidence reviewed in this study makes clear that Iraq's mental health challenges cannot be understood apart from its history of armed conflict. The successive wars that have struck the country since 1980—the Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf War, the sanctions period, the 2003 invasion, and the ISIS insurgency—have not merely increased the number of people needing psychiatric care; they have systematically dismantled the very infrastructure needed to provide that care (Younis & Khunda, 2020; Saied et al., 2023).

	The pattern of infrastructure destruction followed a cumulative trajectory. The Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988) diverted health budgets and resulted in approximately one million casualties. The Gulf War and subsequent UN sanctions then collapsed the economy, reducing monthly wages to one to two US dollars and making psychiatric medications effectively unavailable. By 1998, the psychiatrist-to-population ratio had fallen from 0.5 to 0.1 per 100,000 (Younis & Khunda, 2020). The 2003 invasion brought further devastation: the assassination of 140 doctors, including five psychiatrists, triggered a new wave of brain drain that reduced the psychiatric workforce to 90 practitioners for the entire country. Although numbers recovered somewhat to 160 psychiatrists by 2014, the ratio of 0.34 per 100,000 (Saied et al., 2023) remains among the lowest in the MENA region (Okasha et al., 2025).

	What makes the Iraqi case distinctive is the duration and repetitive nature of the conflict. While other countries in the region have experienced individual episodes of war or political instability, Iraq has endured continuous or near-continuous conflict for over four decades. This sustained disruption has prevented the type of recovery and rebuilding seen in post-conflict countries that experienced shorter periods of violence. The evidence base reflects this reality: psychiatric outpatient attendees increased from 197,000 in 1990 to 507,000 in 1998 (Younis & Khunda, 2020), showing that demand for mental health services was growing precisely during the period when the system's capacity to deliver those services was collapsing.

	The brain drain of mental health professionals deserves special attention because it represents a loss that cannot be quickly reversed. Training a psychiatrist takes over a decade, and the migration of trained specialists to safer countries creates a gap that affects the quality and availability of mental health care for years afterward. Saied et al. (2023) noted that Iraq currently operates with only six specialized psychiatric hospitals for its entire population, and these facilities "do not even meet the bare minimum of demand." The concentration of these hospitals—two in Baghdad and four in the Kurdistan Region—means that vast areas of the country, including conflict-affected governorates in the south and west, have no specialized psychiatric care at all.

### 2. Trauma and Medication Needs: Evidence Integration

	The scale of trauma-related mental illness documented in the reviewed literature creates a medication demand that far exceeds what Iraq's current system can supply. Evidence from multiple sources converges on the conclusion that conflict exposure follows a dose-response pattern with psychiatric morbidity, meaning that the populations with the greatest need are precisely those with the least access to care.

	Hoge et al. (2004) demonstrated this dose-response relationship in US soldiers deployed to Iraq: PTSD rates increased from 4.5% among those with no firefight experience to 19.3% among those who experienced six or more firefights. If this pattern holds for Iraqi civilians—who have experienced decades of combat exposure without the protective structures of a military support system—then the trauma burden on the Iraqi population is likely to be substantial. Saied et al. (2023) estimated that over 20% of Iraqis currently have mental illnesses, a figure that has risen from approximately 10% in 2006, with depression, anxiety, and PTSD being the most commonly observed conditions.

	The evidence on treatment outcomes for trauma-related disorders is sobering. Among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, Berge et al. (2020) found that only approximately 13.5% achieved remission after treatment, with treatment dropout rates reaching 36% in military populations. These figures, drawn from well-resourced military healthcare systems with established treatment protocols, suggest that outcomes in Iraq's under-resourced system are likely even worse. The high dropout rate also indicates that medication alone is not enough; patients need sustained psychosocial support to remain in treatment, and the current shortage of mental health professionals in Iraq makes such support difficult to provide.

	The trauma experienced by specific groups within Iraq adds further complexity to the medication needs picture. Ibrahim et al. (2018) documented that 98.5% of formerly enslaved Yazidi women met criteria for PTSD, with 100% meeting criteria when a culturally validated lower cutoff was applied. The mean PTSD score for these women (61.5) was significantly higher than for non-enslaved women in the same community (47.5), and depression scores followed the same pattern (45.3 vs. 35.7). Yet only 18.5% of the study population had received any psychosocial support. The social rejection experienced by these women—44.6% felt extremely excluded by community members—adds a dimension that complicates pharmacological treatment, because medication cannot address the social drivers of distress. These findings suggest that effective treatment for conflict-related trauma in Iraq requires not only access to psychiatric medication but also community-level interventions that address rejection, shame, and social reintegration.

## C. Healthcare System Challenges and Solutions: Interpreting Evidence

### 1. Alternative Treatment Providers: Evidence Synthesis

	The prominence of faith healers in Iraq's mental health context is not simply a cultural preference—it is a rational response to a system that fails to provide accessible, affordable, and stigma-free care. Younis et al. (2020) found that 73.1% of patients who visited faith healers did so before their first psychiatric consultation, which suggests that faith healers serve as the default first point of contact for many Iraqis experiencing psychological distress. Education was the strongest predictor of faith healer consultation (p<0.001), and patients with psychotic disorders were significantly more likely to visit faith healers than those with depression or anxiety (p=0.02).

	The reasons behind this pattern are not difficult to identify when the evidence is considered holistically. Only 19.2% of Baghdad residents believed that mental health services existed in their community, and only 14.6% thought their local primary care centre provided good mental health care (Sadik et al., 2010). In a context where professional psychiatric services are invisible, unavailable, or perceived as inadequate, faith healers fill a vacuum. They are physically present in communities, culturally familiar, and their interventions align with the supernatural causal models that many Iraqis hold about mental illness—including beliefs in jinn possession and divine punishment that were endorsed by significant proportions of the Baghdad population (Sadik et al., 2010).

	However, the reviewed evidence also shows that faith healer interventions carry significant risks. Beyond the financial costs—77.1% paid fees, with some paying over $1,000—the documented practices included physical exorcism involving beating (13.6%), stabbing or cautery (8.2%), and sexual abuse or harassment (3.6%) (Younis et al., 2020). These findings indicate that the faith healer system, while filling a genuine gap, can cause direct harm to vulnerable patients. The lay beliefs framework identified by Adewuya and Makanjuola (2008) provides context: when 65.5% of a population attributes mental illness to witchcraft or evil spirits and 50.1% to God's will, the logical treatment response is spiritual rather than pharmacological. Changing this pattern requires not dismissing these beliefs but engaging with them—working with religious leaders to incorporate messages about mental health treatment within a spiritual framework that patients trust.

### 2. Primary Care Integration: Evidence-Based Solutions

	The evidence reviewed in this study strongly supports the integration of mental health services into primary care as a strategy for expanding access in Iraq. Cubillos et al. (2021) reviewed 58 studies across 19 low- and middle-income countries and found that integrated care models led to greater reductions in depression severity compared to standard care in 36 of 42 studies. While integration increased direct healthcare costs, it was deemed cost-effective from a healthcare perspective and reduced overall costs from a societal perspective through decreased patient time costs and fewer productivity losses. These findings have direct relevance to Iraq, where the treatment gap reaches up to 90% (Cubillos et al., 2021) and where the current system of six specialized hospitals cannot serve a population of over 40 million.

	The integration approach also offers a potential solution to stigma. Almazeedi and Alsuwaidan (2014) argued that integrating mental health into general health services in Kuwait could reduce stigma by normalizing mental health care within broader healthcare settings. This argument is supported by the Lebanese evidence: Abi Hana et al. (2022) found that service users at integrated primary health care centres reported no experienced discrimination at the facility level, even though community and family stigma remained strong. If patients can receive psychiatric medication through their general practitioner at a primary health care centre—rather than visiting a specialized psychiatric hospital that is identifiable to neighbors and family members—the social cost of seeking treatment decreases substantially.

	For Iraq specifically, the primary care integration model faces several practical challenges. The primary healthcare ratio documented by Sadik et al. (2010) was already strained at 40 health workers and 4 general practitioners per 35,000 population, compared to the UK ratio of 1 GP per 1,700. Adding mental health responsibilities to an already overburdened primary care workforce requires careful planning, training, and supervision. The Cubillos et al. (2021) review identified multiple integration models—including collaborative care, task-shifting with lay health workers, and stepped care—and the choice of model should match Iraq's current capacity. Task-shifting approaches, in which trained community health workers deliver basic mental health interventions under supervision, may be more feasible than collaborative care models that require specialists who are in short supply.

### 3. Medication Management Optimization: Literature-Based Approaches

	The high rates of antipsychotic polypharmacy (47.6%) and high-dose therapy (35.6%) documented at Ibn Rushd Hospital (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026) point to a need for systematic medication management improvement in Iraqi psychiatric practice. The strongest predictor of high-dose therapy was polypharmacy itself (AOR 12.61), suggesting that the two practices are interconnected and that reducing one would likely reduce the other. The absence of clozapine from the Iraqi sample is particularly relevant here, because international guidelines recommend clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia before resorting to antipsychotic combinations—meaning that the polypharmacy observed in Baghdad may partly reflect a gap in the medication formulary rather than a deliberate prescribing choice.

	International evidence provides models for addressing these challenges. Herbert et al. (2020) described a comprehensive medication management program in which pharmacists conducted 1,031 patient encounters across 61 independent pharmacies, identifying drug therapy problems and addressing medication adherence barriers. This type of pharmacist-led medication review could be adapted for Iraqi settings, where pharmacists are often the most accessible healthcare providers. The pharmacist-physician collaboration model studied by Van et al. (2012) found that pre-registration training contact was a significant predictor of later collaborative practice (p<0.001), emphasizing the importance of building professional relationships during training rather than attempting to establish them afterward.

	In the Iraqi context, pharmacists already serve as the first point of contact for many patients seeking medications. However, the knowledge gaps documented by Albaroodi (2019) among pharmacists in Karbala—where 63.6% identified education as the main barrier to improving practice—suggest that expanding the pharmacist's role in mental health care requires investment in continuing education and professional development. A structured training program focused on psychotropic medications, adherence counseling, and recognition of drug therapy problems could equip Iraqi pharmacists to serve as an intermediate layer between patients and the limited number of psychiatrists available in the country.

## D. Vulnerable Populations: Synthesizing Evidence for Tailored Approaches

### 1. Women-Centered Mental Health Services

	The reviewed literature consistently shows that Iraqi women face a disproportionate mental health burden compounded by gender-specific barriers to care. The mortality rate among women aged 15–59 more than doubled after the 2003 invasion, from 0.83 to 1.95 per 1,000, and an estimated 900,000 widows—9% of Iraq's female population—have been created by successive wars, yet only 86,000 receive state pensions (Younis, 2015; Younis & Lafta, 2021). The mental health consequences are severe: the major depressive disorder male-to-female ratio is 1:2.8, PTSD prevalence among women reached 14.09% compared to 3.95% among men during peak violence years, and 91.1% of women in Baghdad have experienced war-related trauma (Saied et al., 2023; Younis & Lafta, 2021).

	These epidemiological findings take on additional meaning when considered alongside the barriers specific to Iraqi women seeking mental health treatment. Female illiteracy stands at 76.7% compared to 45.1% for men (Younis, 2015), and since education is the strongest predictor of both reduced stigma and reduced faith healer consultation, this literacy gap translates directly into reduced access to evidence-based mental health care. The cultural context adds further complexity: in a society where family honor is tied to women's behavior and where mental illness carries social shame (Booth et al., 2024), women face stronger social penalties for seeking psychiatric treatment than men do.

	The experience of infertile women in Basrah illustrates how reproductive and mental health challenges intersect. Al-Asadi and Hussein (2015) found depression prevalence of 68.9% among 251 infertile women, with the husband's threat of remarriage being the strongest risk factor (OR 2.61). In a cultural context where fertility is closely linked to marital security and social status, the psychological distress of infertility is compounded by the threat of marital dissolution—a threat that simultaneously increases the need for mental health support and decreases the likelihood of seeking it, because psychiatric treatment carries its own stigma.

	The extreme case of Yazidi women who survived ISIS enslavement reveals the outer limits of conflict-related trauma and its treatment implications. Ibrahim et al. (2018) found that formerly enslaved women had mean PTSD scores of 61.5 and depression scores of 45.3, with social rejection mediating the relationship between enslavement and depression. Only 18.5% had received any psychosocial support. For this population, psychiatric medication is necessary but not sufficient: the social rejection (44.6% felt extremely excluded) and community judgment (49.2% worried about others' opinions) that these women face require community-level interventions alongside individual treatment. Any approach to women's mental health in Iraq must therefore address not only the clinical disorder but also the social conditions that produce and sustain it.

### 2. Youth and Student Mental Health: Evidence Interpretation

	The evidence on Iraqi university students presents a picture of rising mental health needs combined with moderate stigma levels that continue to deter help-seeking. Mohammed and Memmedova (2023) documented elevated mean scores for stress (3.08), anxiety (2.95), and depression (2.91) among 1,504 students in Iraqi Kurdistan during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Basra study (Kadhim et al., 2024) found that 7.4% of medical-group students used psychotropic medications, with depression or stress after entering college being the strongest associated factor—60.7% of drug users developed these conditions after starting university. Being female, studying outside one's home governorate, and dissatisfaction with studies were also significant predictors of psychotropic medication use.

	These findings suggest that the university period represents both a risk window and an intervention opportunity. Students are old enough to make their own healthcare decisions but young enough to be influenced by educational interventions. The moderate stigma levels documented among University of Baghdad students (Hussein Alwan et al., 2025) indicate that negative attitudes are present but not yet as entrenched as in the general adult population. University settings offer natural platforms for peer education programs, counseling services, and destigmatization campaigns that can reach large numbers of young adults during a formative period.

	However, the fact that 89.3% of psychotropic drug users among Basra students were female (Kadhim et al., 2024) deserves attention. This gender disparity may reflect higher rates of depression and anxiety among female students, but it may also indicate that male students are less willing to use medications—a possibility consistent with the broader literature showing that masculinity norms in Arab cultures discourage acknowledgment of psychological vulnerability (Booth et al., 2024). Effective student mental health programs in Iraq would therefore need to address gender-specific barriers: encouraging women to seek help without social penalty and encouraging men to recognize that medication use is not a sign of weakness.

### 3. Children and Adolescents: Integrating Pediatric Evidence

	The Al-Jawadi and Abdul-Rhman (2007) study of 3,079 children in Mosul documented an overall mental disorder prevalence of 37.4%, with PTSD as the most common diagnosis (10.5%). The finding that prevalence increased with age—from 29.1% among children aged 1–4 to 49.2% among those aged 10–15—indicates a cumulative effect of conflict exposure, meaning that children in Iraq accumulate psychological damage over time rather than adapting to their environment. This has direct implications for medication needs: as children grow older and their symptom burden increases, the need for pharmacological intervention grows alongside.

	Yet the evidence on pediatric psychotropic medication raises significant concerns about the gap between need and practice. International data reviewed by Hamrin et al. (2010) showed that parental attitudes are a major barrier: 69% of parents believed antipsychotics cause addiction, 75% believed antidepressants cause addiction, and 79.7% feared psychiatric medication in general. Among children themselves, 65% tried to avoid taking their medication and only 32% were willing to tell peers about it. While these figures come from Western settings, the parental resistance they document is likely to be even stronger in Iraq, where cultural beliefs about mental illness and medication add further layers of concern.

	The parental factor in pediatric adherence is supported by Kalaman et al. (2023), whose systematic review of 23 studies found that family functioning was the most robust predictor of child medication adherence. The modeling effect is striking: 63% of children showed high adherence when their parents were also adherent with their own medications, compared to 53% when parents were non-adherent. In the Iraqi context, where adult adherence to psychiatric medications is already compromised by stigma, economic barriers, and competing explanatory models, the parental modeling pathway suggests that children's adherence will not improve until adult adherence is addressed. This creates an intergenerational cycle in which parental attitudes and behaviors toward psychiatric medication are transmitted to children, potentially perpetuating low medication acceptance across generations.

### 4. Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons: Evidence Analysis

	The mental health data on Iraqi refugees and displaced populations reveal a pattern of high need, low literacy, and complex treatment-seeking behavior. Slewa-Younan et al. (2014) found that 31.1% of 225 Iraqi refugees in Australia met the threshold for clinically significant PTSD, yet only 14.2% could correctly identify PTSD from a clinical vignette—compared to 34.3% in the general Australian population. The belief that "trying to deal with the problem alone" would be helpful was endorsed by 58.0% of Iraqi refugees, compared to only 6% in the general Australian population. This nearly tenfold difference reflects deeply ingrained cultural norms of self-reliance that persist even after resettlement in a country with accessible mental health services.

	Medication adherence among displaced populations is severely compromised. Dikeç and Timarcıoğlu (2023) documented that 78.2% of Syrian refugees receiving psychiatric care in Turkey had poor medication adherence, despite a mean illness duration of 63.16 months. The barriers they identified—cultural attitudes, language differences, transportation costs, and reliance on family and religious leaders before seeking medical care—are equally relevant to internally displaced Iraqis. With 1.5 million Iraqis internally displaced and 2.5 million in exile (Younis, 2015), medication continuity during displacement represents a major public health challenge.

	The evidence does, however, offer a path forward. Uribe Guajardo et al. (2018) demonstrated that a brief 7-hour Mental Health Literacy training course for community-based workers supporting Iraqi refugees significantly improved PTSD recognition (from 56.9% to 76.5%) and reduced social distance toward people with mental health problems. The effect sizes were meaningful: Cohen's d of 0.73 for PTSD confidence and 0.80 for depression confidence. These results show that relatively short, culturally adapted training programs can produce measurable improvements in the mental health response capacity of communities serving displaced Iraqis. The key insight is that training does not need to be lengthy or expensive to be effective—it needs to be targeted, practical, and culturally appropriate.

## E. Mental Health Literacy and Public Education: Evidence Synthesis

### 1. Current State of Mental Health Literacy from Reviewed Studies

	The evidence from across the Gulf region points to widespread deficits in mental health literacy that directly affect medication acceptance. Elyamani et al. (2021) found that fewer than 50% of participants across GCC states could recognize common mental disorders, and half of respondents did not believe in medication as a treatment for mental illness. In Saudi Arabia, 48% of participants lacked knowledge about bipolar disorder. Healthcare professionals—who might be expected to serve as gatekeepers for accurate mental health information—demonstrated only intermediate-to-limited knowledge despite their training. The review found no interventional studies targeting mental health literacy in the entire GCC region, representing a significant gap between the documented problem and any systematic effort to address it.

	Among Iraqi populations specifically, the literacy gap manifests in distinctive ways. The Baghdad survey by Sadik et al. (2010) found that only 15.7% of residents were aware that mental health information was available at primary healthcare centres, and only 19.2% believed mental health services existed in their community. This means that even if services are technically available, the public does not know about them—an information barrier that functions as an access barrier. The explanatory models held by the public further complicate the picture: approximately 60% attributed mental illness to brain disease (a partially accurate view), but 59% also attributed it to personal weakness and 30% to God's punishment (Sadik et al., 2010). These mixed causal attributions mean that many Iraqis hold both biomedical and supernatural explanatory models simultaneously, creating cognitive dissonance about whether psychiatric medication is an appropriate response.

	The Iraqi refugee data add another dimension. Slewa-Younan et al. (2014) found that longer duration of resettlement in Australia predicted greater endorsement of professional mental health services, suggesting that exposure to a culture with higher mental health literacy gradually shifts treatment beliefs. This acculturation effect offers an important insight: mental health literacy is not fixed but malleable, and sustained educational effort can change deeply held beliefs about mental illness and its treatment—even among populations with initially low literacy.

### 2. Strategies for Improving Literacy: Evidence-Based Approaches

	The evidence reviewed in this study suggests that effective mental health literacy interventions share several features: they are brief, practically focused, culturally adapted, and targeted to specific audiences. The most directly relevant finding comes from Uribe Guajardo et al. (2018), whose 7-hour training course for community-based workers improved PTSD recognition by nearly 20 percentage points and significantly reduced social distance. The brevity and effectiveness of this intervention are notable because they challenge the assumption that changing deeply held beliefs requires lengthy educational programs.

	At the broader population level, Angermeyer et al. (2017) documented a slow but steady increase in public willingness to recommend psychiatric treatment, with medication recommendations increasing at a rate of 1.10% per year for depression and 1.45% per year for schizophrenia across multiple countries. These trends suggest that population-level attitudes can shift over time, but the rate of change is gradual—approximately a decade to produce a 10–15 percentage point improvement. For Iraq, where baseline attitudes are more negative than in the Western populations studied by Angermeyer et al., the time required for meaningful change may be even longer, reinforcing the need for sustained rather than one-time educational campaigns.

	The media and community approaches documented in the broader literature could be adapted for the Iraqi context. The Kuwaiti model described by Almazeedi and Alsuwaidan (2014) advocated for celebrity endorsements, role models, and integration with religious leaders as culturally appropriate strategies for reducing stigma and increasing mental health literacy. Given the central role of faith in Iraqi society—where 79.2% of Iraqi refugees endorsed reading the Quran as helpful for mental health problems (Slewa-Younan et al., 2014)—any literacy campaign that fails to engage religious leaders and frame mental health treatment within a spiritual context is unlikely to reach the populations most in need.

## F. Comparative Analysis: Positioning Iraq within Regional and Global Context

### 1. Iraq vs. MENA Region: Evidence Comparison

	When the Iraqi findings reviewed in this study are placed alongside regional comparisons, both shared patterns and distinctive features become apparent. The stigma patterns are broadly similar across the MENA region: Booth et al. (2024) documented that one in four Arabs hold stigmatizing attitudes, and Elyamani et al. (2021) found that fewer than half of GCC populations can recognize common mental disorders. The preference for faith healers and religious interventions is not unique to Iraq—GCC populations similarly endorse prayer and Quranic recitation as treatments for mental illness (Elyamani et al., 2021), and in Lebanon, the mental health treatment gap exceeds 90% with most people not perceiving a need for treatment (Abi Hana et al., 2022).

	However, Iraq's position within this regional picture is uniquely disadvantaged in several respects. First, the psychiatrist-to-population ratio (0.34 per 100,000) places Iraq among the least-served countries in the region, grouped with conflict-affected states rather than with the relatively better-resourced Gulf nations that have higher ratios (Okasha et al., 2025). Second, the duration and intensity of conflict that Iraq has experienced exceeds that of most MENA countries, with the exception of Syria—and the Iraqi evidence predates the Syrian conflict, meaning that Iraq has lived with the consequences of war on mental health for longer. Third, the combination of high trauma burden, severe workforce shortages, and widespread faith healer reliance creates a triple challenge that is more severe than in most neighboring countries.

	The prescribing pattern data reveal another distinctive feature. The polypharmacy rate in Baghdad (47.6%) is comparable to Qatar's (44.1%), but both exceed the global median of 19.6% (Ouanes et al., 2020). This suggests that high polypharmacy is a regional rather than uniquely Iraqi phenomenon, possibly driven by limited access to clozapine and prescriber preferences shaped by training and medication availability. The complete absence of clozapine in the Iraqi sample, however, distinguishes Iraq from Qatar and other Gulf states where at least some clozapine use exists. Addressing the clozapine gap should be considered a priority for improving the quality of psychiatric pharmacotherapy in Iraq.

### 2. Lessons from International Contexts: Transferable Evidence

	International evidence provides several models that could be adapted for the Iraqi context, though adaptation rather than direct transplantation is essential. The adherence intervention literature offers a clear lesson: short, focused interventions that specifically target adherence are more effective than broad-based programs. In schizophrenia, adherence-specific interventions showed a 55% success rate compared to only 26% for broadly-based interventions (Zygmunt et al., 2002). Compliance therapy, which combines motivational interviewing with cognitive techniques, sustained adherence gains over 18 months—suggesting that brief but well-designed interventions can have lasting effects.

	The primary care integration evidence from low- and middle-income countries is directly applicable. Cubillos et al. (2021) identified collaborative care and task-shifting as effective models, with the latter being more suitable for resource-limited settings. Iraq's primary care infrastructure, while strained, is more developed than its specialized psychiatric services, making it a logical platform for mental health service expansion. The evidence that integration reduces stigma by normalizing mental health care within general healthcare settings (Almazeedi & Alsuwaidan, 2014) addresses one of Iraq's most significant barriers simultaneously.

	The American data on changing attitudes (Mojtabai, 2009) show that public willingness to take psychiatric medications can increase over relatively short periods—from 41.2% to 49.1% for depression and from 35.5% to 46.6% for stress coping between 1998 and 2006. However, the same data revealed persistent disparities: Black respondents were significantly less willing to use psychiatric medications (AOR=0.54), and those with more education paradoxically endorsed benefits but were less willing to take medications themselves. These findings caution against assuming that improved knowledge automatically translates into behavior change—a lesson particularly relevant in Iraq, where educated populations may understand the value of psychiatric medication intellectually while remaining unwilling to use it personally due to social consequences.

## G. Knowledge Gaps and Limitations of Reviewed Literature

	Several significant gaps in the available evidence limit the conclusions that can be drawn from this review. First, Iraq-specific empirical research on psychiatric medication use and public acceptance remains limited. The two primary Iraqi studies on prescribing patterns (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026; Kadhim et al., 2024) cover only inpatients at one Baghdad hospital and medical students at one Basra university, respectively. No large-scale population-based studies of psychotropic medication prevalence, prescribing quality, or patient outcomes were identified in the reviewed literature. This means that the patterns described in this review may not be representative of psychiatric practice across Iraq's diverse geographic and demographic settings.

	Second, the geographic coverage of the reviewed Iraqi studies is concentrated in Baghdad, Basra, and the Kurdistan Region, with no studies from several governorates—particularly in western and southern Iraq—where conflict exposure has been high and healthcare access is lowest. The Mosul study by Al-Jawadi and Abdul-Rhman (2007) was conducted during 2003–2004, immediately after the invasion, and the situation has changed substantially since then, including the devastation of the ISIS conflict. Updated data from conflict-affected areas outside the major cities are urgently needed to complete the picture of psychiatric medication use across Iraq.

	Third, this review necessarily relied on regional studies from Kuwait, Qatar, Lebanon, and other MENA countries to contextualize Iraqi findings. While these comparisons are informative, the transferability of findings across countries with different healthcare systems, economic conditions, and conflict histories is limited. The polypharmacy rates in Qatar (Ouanes et al., 2020) provide a useful benchmark, but Qatar's healthcare resources and per-capita spending are vastly different from Iraq's, and prescribing practices in one country may not reflect the same underlying factors as in another.

	Fourth, publication bias and language limitations affect the scope of this review. The search was limited to English and Arabic sources, potentially missing relevant studies published in Kurdish or other languages. The rapid pace of change in Iraq—including ongoing security developments, healthcare reforms, and demographic shifts—means that some of the evidence reviewed here, particularly from the early 2000s, may not fully reflect current conditions. Finally, the methodological diversity of the reviewed studies—ranging from large epidemiological surveys to small qualitative interviews—makes direct comparison difficult, and the absence of randomized controlled trials in Iraqi mental health settings limits the strength of evidence available to guide clinical practice and policy.
