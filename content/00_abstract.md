# ABSTRACT

	Iraq's population carries one of the heaviest mental health burdens in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, shaped by more than four decades of war, economic sanctions, and social disruption. Over 20% of Iraqis are estimated to suffer from mental disorders, yet only 6.12% of those affected receive any form of treatment. This narrative literature review synthesizes evidence from 48 sources—including Iraqi empirical studies, regional research, systematic reviews, and policy documents—to examine patterns of psychiatric medication use, public attitudes, and barriers to medication acceptance in Iraq.

	The reviewed evidence reveals several critical patterns. In Iraqi psychiatric inpatient settings, prescribing is dominated by a narrow range of second-generation antipsychotics, with olanzapine prescribed to 73.3% of patients and antipsychotic polypharmacy reaching 47.6%—more than double the global median. Clozapine, the gold-standard treatment for resistant schizophrenia, is completely absent from the Iraqi formulary. Among university students, psychotropic medication use is shaped more by cost and availability than by clinical guidance, with self-medication and irregular use remaining common.

	Public attitudes toward mental illness in Iraq are deeply negative. Over 83% of Baghdad residents blamed individuals with mental illness for their condition, and 57.9% of psychiatric patients consulted faith healers—most before seeking professional care. Stigma operates at every level, from individual self-stigma to institutional barriers, and functions as a structural force that redirects patients away from evidence-based treatment. Medication adherence is compromised across all studied populations, driven by self-stigma, economic barriers, side effects, poor insight, and competing cultural explanatory models.

	This review identifies the pharmacist as a central but underused figure in improving psychiatric medication outcomes in Iraq. It recommends pharmacist-led medication management, culturally grounded anti-stigma campaigns that engage religious leaders, integration of mental health into primary care, and the inclusion of clozapine in the national essential medicines list. These evidence-based strategies offer practical pathways to reduce the treatment gap in a country where psychiatrists remain scarce and pharmacies serve as the most accessible point of healthcare contact.
