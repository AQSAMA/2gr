# I. INTRODUCTION

## A. Background and Context

### 1. Mental Health Crisis in Post-Conflict Iraq

	Over two decades of war, political instability, and prolonged conflict have left deep psychological scars on the Iraqi population. The country has experienced the Iran-Iraq war (1980–1988), the Gulf War (1991), years of comprehensive economic sanctions (1990–2003), the US-led invasion in 2003, and the battle against the Islamic State (2014–2017). Each wave of violence displaced millions, separated families, and exposed civilians to extreme trauma. Today, more than 20% of Iraqis are estimated to suffer from mental disorders, and this figure continues to rise (Saied et al., 2023). A Baghdad-based study found that 91.1% of women in the capital had experienced war-related trauma over the past two decades, with women representing approximately 44% of all patients attending psychiatric clinics (Saied et al., 2023). Anxiety disorders are the most common class (13.8%), while major depressive disorder affects 7.2% of the population (Sadik et al., 2010).

	The mental health system in Iraq was not equipped to handle this burden. Before 2003, Iraq had approximately 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, a number that dropped to just 0.1 per 100,000 by 1998 due to the brain drain caused by economic sanctions and war (Younis & Khunda, 2020). Currently, Iraq has only six specialized psychiatric hospitals—two in Baghdad and four in the Kurdistan region—which fall far short of meeting the population's needs (Saied et al., 2023). The mental health workforce is similarly sparse; Iraq currently has around 0.34 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, with severe shortages of psychiatric nurses, psychologists, and social workers (Saied et al., 2023). This shortage means that millions of Iraqis who need mental health care cannot access it.

	The situation was worsened by the collapse of infrastructure during conflicts. Younis and Khunda (2020) documented how the number of patients attending psychiatric outpatient clinics increased dramatically during the sanctions years, rising from 197,000 in 1990 to 507,000 in 1998, while at the same time the number of psychiatrists decreased due to migration. The 2003 invasion resulted in further deterioration; violence, looting, and the dismantling of Iraqi security forces led to assassinations of medical professionals, including five psychiatrists, causing another wave of brain drain (Younis & Khunda, 2020). Between the 1991 and 2003 conflicts, an estimated 10% of the Iraqi population was affected by psychiatric disorders, mostly post-traumatic stress disorder (World Health Organization, 2006, as cited in Younis & Khunda, 2020).

	Beyond the immediate effects of violence, the social fabric of Iraqi society has been strained. The battle against ISIS from 2014 to 2017 created a new wave of war-traumatized patients and internally displaced families, particularly affecting women and children who lost male family members. The number of widows and orphans requiring psychiatric and social care increased substantially, and cultural beliefs meant that many women preferred to be treated by female psychiatrists—a workforce that remains limited (Younis & Khunda, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic further compounded existing mental health challenges, adding social isolation, fear, and future anxiety to an already traumatized population (Saied et al., 2023).

### 2. Overview of Psychiatric Medications and Their Importance

	Psychiatric medications are a critical intervention for the acute and long-term management of severe mental illness, including psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and treatment-resistant depression. These medications broadly fall into two categories: first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine, which work primarily through dopamine receptor antagonism; and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, which block both serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026). Clinical guidelines recommend antipsychotic monotherapy at the lowest effective dose, reserving high-dose therapy only for treatment-resistant cases after trials of two different antipsychotics and clozapine have failed (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026).

	In Iraq, prescribing patterns often deviate from these evidence-based recommendations. A recent study at Ibn Rushd Psychiatric Teaching Hospital in Baghdad found that 48.6% of psychiatric inpatients received antipsychotic polypharmacy, and 35.6% were prescribed high-dose antipsychotics—meaning approximately one in three patients received doses exceeding recommended limits (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026). This practice carries significant safety concerns, as high-dose antipsychotic therapy is associated with increased risk of sedation, extrapyramidal side effects, metabolic complications, cardiac arrhythmias, and even sudden cardiac death. The incidence of sudden cardiac death approximately doubles in patients receiving high doses compared to those on low doses (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026).

	The importance of appropriate psychiatric medication extends beyond individual patient outcomes. Untreated or undertreated mental illness carries substantial costs, including longer duration of illness, more psychiatric episodes, reduced likelihood of remission, poorer functional outcomes, and greater relapse rates (Hamrin et al., 2010). For children and adolescents, untreated mental health problems lead to poorer academic performance, increased peer problems, elevated suicide risk, and significant stress on family functioning (Hamrin et al., 2010). While advances in psychotropic medications have led to greater efficacy and improved side effect profiles, the benefits can only be realized if patients initiate and maintain treatment. Unfortunately, medication adherence remains problematic across all age groups, with studies showing adherence rates ranging from 34% to 89% depending on the population and measurement method (Hamrin et al., 2010).

### 3. The Role of Public Acceptance in Treatment Outcomes

	Public acceptance of psychiatric treatment is a critical determinant of whether patients seek care, initiate medication, and remain adherent to treatment regimens. Stigma—the process by which negative societal attitudes lead to discrimination, exclusion, and reduced self-esteem—represents the single greatest barrier to mental health care seeking worldwide (Zolezzi et al., 2018). In the context of mental health, public stigma occurs when members of the general public endorse negative stereotypes about mental illness and act upon them through fear, rejection, avoidance, and discrimination against affected individuals (Zolezzi et al., 2018).

	The impact of stigma on help-seeking behavior is particularly severe among military populations and can be generalized to post-conflict civilian societies like Iraq. Research has shown that approximately 60% of military personnel who experience mental health problems avoid seeking help, citing concerns about stigma as a primary barrier (Rasheed et al., 2026). Stigma in these contexts manifests in three main forms: public stigma (negative societal perceptions), self-stigma (internalization of negative beliefs leading to shame and reduced self-esteem), and institutional stigma (organizational barriers that disadvantage those who seek care) (Rasheed et al., 2026). When untreated, stigma-linked mental illness increases the risk of suicide and substance abuse, creating a cycle that perpetuates poor outcomes.

	In Arab cultures, stigma toward mental illness is shaped by specific cultural and religious beliefs. A systematic review found that many Arabs attribute mental illness to supernatural causes such as evil spirits, demons, black magic, or divine punishment (Zolezzi et al., 2018). These beliefs influence treatment-seeking behavior, with many individuals preferring traditional healers or religious interventions over psychiatric care. Studies conducted in Qatar found that Qatari nationals, compared to non-Qatari Arabs, were more likely to view mental illness as God's punishment, prefer traditional healers, and believe that psychiatric medications cause addiction (Zolezzi et al., 2018). Fear of side effects and addiction are common across Arab populations and represent significant barriers to medication acceptance (Zolezzi et al., 2018).

	Public acceptance thus determines not only whether individuals seek treatment but also whether they adhere to prescribed medications. Without addressing the cultural and social barriers that prevent Iraqis from accepting psychiatric care, any investment in expanding mental health services or improving medication availability will fail to reach those who need it most.

## B. Problem Statement

	Despite the high prevalence of mental disorders in Iraq—affecting more than 18% of the population with lifetime prevalence—access to treatment remains severely limited. Data from the Iraqi Mental Health Survey indicate that only 6.12% of those with mental health problems receive any treatment (Sadik et al., 2010; Saied et al., 2023). This treatment gap is driven by multiple intersecting factors: an underdeveloped mental health system with severe workforce shortages, infrastructure destroyed by decades of conflict, and perhaps most significantly, deep-rooted stigma and negative public attitudes that prevent individuals from seeking care.

	A landmark survey of public attitudes in Baghdad found that while approximately 60% of respondents understood that mental illness is caused by brain disease and 50% recognized genetic factors, two-thirds still attributed mental illness to "something bad happening to you" and nearly two-thirds viewed personal weakness as a cause (Sadik et al., 2010). More troubling, four-fifths of respondents believed that people with mental health problems are largely to blame for their condition. Over half thought people with mental illness are identifiable by their appearance and incapable of true friendship, while about half believed they should not marry or have children (Sadik et al., 2010). These attitudes create a social environment in which seeking psychiatric care—let alone adhering to psychiatric medications—carries profound personal and social costs.

	The Iraqi context presents unique challenges that distinguish it from other settings. Unlike countries where mental health services have developed incrementally over generations, Iraq must simultaneously rebuild physical healthcare infrastructure, train a new generation of mental health professionals, and change deeply ingrained cultural attitudes—all while the population continues to experience ongoing stressors from economic instability, displacement, and residual violence. Research on psychiatric medication use and public acceptance specific to the Iraqi population remains limited, fragmented across different domains, and has not been systematically synthesized to inform policy or clinical practice.

## C. Review Objectives

	This literature review aims to address the identified gaps by systematically examining the available evidence on psychiatric medication use and public acceptance in Iraq. The specific objectives are:

	First, this review synthesizes existing evidence on the patterns of psychiatric medication use in Iraq, including prescribing practices, medication types, and dosing patterns within the Iraqi healthcare context. Second, it reviews and analyzes public attitudes toward psychiatric medications in Iraq, including cultural beliefs, stigma, and their influence on treatment acceptance. Third, the review identifies and categorizes barriers to medication acceptance and adherence based on published literature, distinguishing between patient-level factors, healthcare system factors, and sociocultural factors. Fourth, based on the synthesized evidence, the review proposes recommendations grounded in the reviewed studies to improve psychiatric medication acceptance and appropriate use in Iraq.

## D. Significance of the Review

	This literature review holds significant value for multiple stakeholders in the Iraqi healthcare system. For Iraqi pharmacists and clinical practitioners, this work provides a consolidated synthesis of fragmented knowledge on psychiatric medication use, prescribing patterns, and the factors that influence patient acceptance. Understanding these factors is essential for pharmacists who interact daily with patients and their families, often serving as the first point of contact in a healthcare system where psychiatric specialists remain scarce.

	For healthcare educators and academic institutions, this review offers a comprehensive overview that can inform curriculum development for pharmacy and medical students. The cultural dimensions of psychiatric care—including the influence of religious beliefs, family dynamics, and community attitudes on medication acceptance—represent knowledge that cannot be learned from Western textbooks alone. By synthesizing Iraqi-specific and regional evidence, this review contributes teaching material that is directly relevant to the local context.

	For policymakers and the Iraqi Ministry of Health, this review identifies knowledge gaps and provides evidence-based insights that can inform the development of national mental health policies and suicide prevention strategies. Iraq passed mental health legislation in 2005 and developed a stand-alone mental health policy in 2017, yet implementation remains limited (Saied et al., 2023). Effective policy requires understanding not only the clinical aspects of psychiatric care but also the social and cultural barriers that prevent the population from benefiting from available services.

	Finally, this review contributes to the broader literature on mental health in the Middle East and North Africa region. While stigma toward mental illness exists across Arab countries, manifestations vary by national context, level of development, and exposure to conflict. By focusing specifically on Iraq—a country with one of the most severe mental health burdens and least developed service systems in the region—this review provides insights that may inform approaches in other post-conflict settings facing similar challenges.
