# II. LITERATURE REVIEW

	This section establishes the global and theoretical context for understanding psychiatric medication use and public acceptance in Iraq. It examines definitions of stigma, frameworks for understanding medication adherence, and general trends across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Specific Iraqi statistics and findings are presented separately in Section IV (Key Findings from Literature).

## A. Mental Health Stigma: Global to Local Context

### 1. Theoretical Framework of Mental Health Stigma

	Mental health stigma remains one of the most significant barriers to psychiatric care worldwide. Goffman's seminal work defines stigma as an attribute that devalues a person and sets them apart from others, making individuals with mental illness particularly vulnerable to discrimination and exclusion (Booth et al., 2024). This definition captures the core mechanism through which societal attitudes translate into concrete disadvantages for affected individuals. In the mental health context, public stigma occurs when members of the general public endorse negative stereotypes about mental illness and act upon them through fear, rejection, avoidance, and discriminatory behavior against affected individuals (Zolezzi et al., 2018).

	Research has identified three interlinked levels at which stigma operates within healthcare settings: structural stigma (represented by policies and legislation), interpersonal stigma (constituted by the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of healthcare providers and one's community), and intrapersonal stigma (connoted by negative beliefs about the self, including both self-stigma and internalized stigma) (Abi Hana et al., 2022). These three levels interact in complex ways. For instance, healthcare professionals' behavior can amplify experiences of self-stigma, particularly when they describe mental health conditions using stigmatizing or judgmental terms instead of attempting to understand the person's experience with their illness (Abi Hana et al., 2022).

	A systematic review and meta-analysis of population surveys conducted since 2000 found that professional help for mental disorders generally enjoys high esteem among the public (Angermeyer et al., 2017). The proportion of respondents recommending professional help ranged from 68% to 85% across studies. Psychotherapy is consistently preferred over medication across all examined populations, and attitudes toward seeking help from psychiatrists and psychologists have markedly improved over the past twenty-five years (Angermeyer et al., 2017). These improvements suggest that global anti-stigma campaigns and increased mental health literacy have had measurable effects, though regional variations persist.

	The relationship between biological concepts of mental illness and public attitudes presents a complex picture. While biological explanations of mental illness are associated with stronger approval of psychiatric help, particularly medication, they do not necessarily reduce social distance from affected individuals (Angermeyer et al., 2017). This finding challenges the assumption that increased understanding of the neurobiological basis of mental illness automatically leads to greater acceptance of affected individuals. Self-stigma and negative attitudes toward persons with mental illness decrease the likelihood of personally considering psychiatric help, creating a barrier that operates independently of knowledge about treatment effectiveness (Angermeyer et al., 2017).

### 2. Stigma in Arab and Middle Eastern Cultures

	Mental health stigma in Arab and Middle Eastern cultures is shaped by specific cultural and religious factors that distinguish it from patterns observed in Western societies. A systematic review examining stigmatizing beliefs, actions, and attitudes toward mental illness treatment among Arab populations identified large diversity in these attitudes, while also noting common themes that transcend national boundaries (Zolezzi et al., 2018). Among the studies reviewed, many compared stigmatizing beliefs and attitudes toward mental health treatments among different Arab populations, with some also investigating correlations between characteristics of the Arab population and stigmatizing beliefs.

	Several culturally-related beliefs emerged consistently across studies. These include perceptions that mental illness originates from evil spirits, demons, black magic, or God's punishment—attributions that are more commonly held in Arab societies compared to Western populations (Zolezzi et al., 2018). Another common belief is the negative view of mentally ill patients as incapable of looking after themselves, dangerous, incompetent, or less intelligent. Studies conducted in Qatar, for example, found that Qatari nationals, compared to non-Qatari Arabs, were more likely to view mental illness as God's punishment, prefer traditional healers, and believe that psychiatric medications cause addiction (Zolezzi et al., 2018).

	In conservative communities across the MENA region, mental health stigma is particularly pronounced due to the influence of collective social structures (Booth et al., 2024). Research has shown that the stigma related to mental health in Arab collectivist societies extends beyond the sufferer to the whole family, impacting their reputation; therefore, the stigma is exacerbated for people with mental illness due to concerns about the impact on their wider family as well as themselves. In communities where traditional family values and the notion of "honor" exist, mental health issues are more likely to be perceived as threatening the integrity of the family (Booth et al., 2024).

	A cross-cultural comparison of mental illness stigma and help-seeking attitudes conducted across 16 Arab countries found that out of 10,036 respondents, one in four held stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health and negative attitudes toward seeking support (Booth et al., 2024). This pattern has significant implications for treatment-seeking behavior, as individuals may avoid psychiatric care to protect their own and their family's social standing.

	The structure of mental health services across the MENA region has been evolving in response to these challenges. Egypt, which has the largest population in the Arab world, has undergone significant reforms since 2001, including the development of the Mental Health Act in 2009, increased investments, awareness campaigns, and national programs combating stigma and discrimination against individuals with mental health conditions (Okasha et al., 2025). These changes in Egypt have mirrored broader transformations in the Arab region, where large mental hospitals are gradually being replaced by psychiatric units within general hospitals, with some countries further decentralizing psychiatric services to district hospitals and smaller peripheral units (Okasha et al., 2025).

	The historical and cultural context of mental healthcare in the MENA region provides important background for understanding current attitudes. Mental health awareness in this region dates back centuries, as evidenced by an ancient Egyptian papyrus from the Pharaonic period documenting mental illness (Okasha et al., 2025). The establishment of the first Islamic mental hospital in Baghdad around 705 AD marked a significant advancement in mental healthcare, with subsequent hospitals in Cairo, Damascus, and Aleppo. By the ninth century, the Arab world had developed diagnostic and treatment practices for mental health issues, including identifying eating disorders and documenting depressive illness. This rich heritage suggests that negative attitudes toward mental illness are not inherent to the culture but have developed through complex historical and social processes.

	Culture continues to play a role in the clinical presentation and management of psychiatric conditions. In Arab culture, physical symptoms often serve as the primary indicator of illness, with psychological distress sometimes dismissed or stigmatized (Okasha et al., 2025). Patients and families may express distress through physical complaints rather than emotional language, complicating access to mental health services. This somatic presentation style has implications for how pharmacists and other healthcare providers should approach patients who may be experiencing mental health difficulties.

### 3. Impact of Stigma on Healthcare-Seeking Behavior

	The impact of stigma on help-seeking behavior has been documented across multiple populations and settings. Research among military populations—which can serve as a model for understanding stigma in post-conflict civilian societies—has shown that approximately 60% of individuals who experience mental health problems avoid seeking help, citing concerns about stigma as a primary barrier (Rasheed et al., 2026). Stigma in these contexts manifests in three main forms: public stigma (negative societal perceptions), self-stigma (internalization of negative beliefs leading to shame and reduced self-esteem), and institutional stigma (organizational barriers that disadvantage those who seek care) (Rasheed et al., 2026).

	The relationship between self-stigma and medication adherence has been examined in multiple studies. Research conducted among patients with mental illness in Ethiopia found significant associations between self-stigma and reduced medication adherence (Abdisa et al., 2020). Self-stigma operates through multiple mechanisms: it reduces self-esteem and self-efficacy, which in turn diminishes the perceived value of treatment and the motivation to adhere to prescribed regimens. Patients who internalize negative societal views about mental illness may come to believe that they do not deserve treatment or that treatment is unlikely to help them.

	When stigma prevents individuals from seeking care, the consequences extend beyond the individual to affect families and communities. Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness carries substantial costs, including longer duration of illness, more psychiatric episodes, reduced likelihood of remission, poorer functional outcomes, and greater relapse rates. The presence of stigma-linked mental illness also increases the risk of suicide and substance abuse, creating a cycle that perpetuates poor outcomes (Rasheed et al., 2026).

	Addressing stigma requires interventions at multiple levels. At the structural level, policy reforms and anti-discrimination legislation can reduce institutional barriers. At the interpersonal level, education programs for healthcare providers and the general public can modify attitudes and behaviors. At the intrapersonal level, interventions that build self-esteem and challenge internalized negative beliefs can help individuals overcome self-stigma. The integration of mental health services into primary care has been proposed as one strategy for reducing stigma, as it normalizes help-seeking and reduces the visibility of psychiatric treatment (Almazeedi & Alsuwaidan, 2014).

## B. Public Attitudes Toward Psychiatric Medications

### 1. Global Perspectives on Medication Attitudes

	Public attitudes toward psychiatric medications have been studied extensively in Western populations, providing a benchmark against which regional variations can be understood. A longitudinal analysis of attitudes in the United States between 1998 and 2006 found that public opinions regarding the benefits of psychiatric medications became more favorable over this period (Mojtabai, 2009). More participants in 2006 than in 1998 thought that medications help people deal with day-to-day stresses (83.4% versus 77.8%), make things easier in relation with family and friends (75.9% versus 68.4%), and help people feel better about themselves (68.0% versus 60.1%). The public also expressed greater willingness to take medications for various conditions, including trouble in personal life, coping with life stresses, depression, and panic attacks (Mojtabai, 2009).

	These findings reflect a broader trend toward acceptance of psychiatric treatment in Western societies. The factors driving this change likely include increased public awareness of mental disorders through media coverage and educational campaigns, the development of newer medications with improved side effect profiles, direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising, and the growing number of individuals with personal or family experience of psychiatric treatment. Similar trends have been documented in Australia, Germany, and other developed nations, where recommendations for psychiatric medication use have increased over recent decades (Mojtabai, 2009).

	Despite these improvements in overall attitudes, concerns about psychiatric medications persist. Opinions regarding the risks of medications did not change significantly between 1998 and 2006 in the US population, suggesting that while benefits are increasingly recognized, fears about side effects, dependency, and other harms remain stable (Mojtabai, 2009). This pattern has implications for medication adherence: even when individuals initiate treatment, ongoing concerns about medication risks may contribute to premature discontinuation.

	A framework for understanding individual variation in medication attitudes was developed through the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) (Horne et al., 1999). This instrument assesses two dimensions of medication beliefs: beliefs about the necessity of prescribed medication and concerns about prescribed medication based on fears of dependence, long-term toxicity, and disruptive effects. The questionnaire also assesses general beliefs that medicines are harmful, addictive, or overused by doctors. Research using the BMQ has demonstrated that the balance between perceived necessity and concerns predicts medication adherence across multiple chronic conditions, including psychiatric disorders (Horne et al., 1999).

	The necessity-concerns framework has particular relevance for understanding medication acceptance in populations with high levels of skepticism about psychiatric treatment. When concerns outweigh perceived necessity, patients are more likely to be non-adherent or to discontinue treatment prematurely. Interventions that address specific concerns while reinforcing the necessity of treatment may be more effective than generic educational approaches.

### 2. Mental Health Literacy in the Gulf Cooperation Council

	Mental health literacy—defined as knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid their recognition, management, or prevention—has been relatively neglected in the MENA region despite the increase in mental health illness burden (Elyamani et al., 2021). A systematic review of studies from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries found that limited mental health literacy was observed among participants, even among healthcare professionals. Results also showed a high cumulative level of stigma and negative attitudes toward mental illness in the public, with negative beliefs and inappropriate practices being common (Elyamani et al., 2021).

	The review included 27 studies with a total of 16,391 participants, primarily adults from the community. Almost half the studies were conducted in Saudi Arabia, with others from the UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait. Common demographic predictors of a lower level of recognizing mental illnesses across studies included younger age, unemployment, illiteracy, and female gender (Elyamani et al., 2021). These findings suggest that mental health literacy interventions should be targeted toward these demographic groups.

	Almost all included studies revealed an average level of mental health literacy, with some studies showing that less than 50% of participants could recognize common mental disorders. The majority of studies revealed a high proportion of participants holding negative attitudes toward mental disorders and people with mental illness (Elyamani et al., 2021). Healthcare professionals and students showed somewhat better levels of knowledge than the general public, but gaps remained significant even among these groups.

	The low levels of mental health literacy in GCC countries have direct implications for medication acceptance. Individuals who cannot recognize mental illness in themselves or others are unlikely to seek appropriate treatment, and those who hold negative attitudes toward mental disorders may resist psychiatric medication even when prescribed. The systematic review concluded that campaigns to promote early identification and treatment of mental illness are needed to improve overall levels of mental health literacy in the general population of the GCC region (Elyamani et al., 2021).

	Efforts to improve mental health services have been undertaken across the GCC region. In Kuwait, mental illness stigma represents a significant barrier to care, with cultural factors directing people's preferences toward self-help or traditional healers rather than psychiatric services (Almazeedi & Alsuwaidan, 2014). Kuwaitis are accustomed to a neighborhood structure centered around primary care clinics where residents develop close relationships with family physicians. The World Health Organization's recommendation to integrate mental healthcare into general health services has been proposed as a strategy to overcome stigma by making psychiatric services available in socially acceptable locations (Almazeedi & Alsuwaidan, 2014).

### 3. Iraqi Refugee Populations: Mental Health Literacy

	Studies of Iraqi refugee populations provide insights into how mental health knowledge and attitudes may be shaped by displacement and exposure to different healthcare systems. Research among Iraqi refugees resettled in Australia found variable levels of mental health literacy, with particular gaps in knowledge about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and evidence-based treatments (Slewa-Younan et al., 2014). Despite high exposure to potentially traumatic events, many refugees did not recognize PTSD symptoms as indicative of a treatable condition, and preferences for traditional or religious interventions often exceeded those for professional psychiatric care.

	Intervention studies have demonstrated that mental health literacy can be improved through targeted training programs. A program designed to improve the capacity of community-based workers in Australia to provide initial assistance to Iraqi refugees with mental health problems showed positive results (Uribe Guajardo et al., 2018). Participants gained knowledge about mental health conditions and appropriate help-seeking pathways, suggesting that community-based educational approaches may be effective for improving mental health literacy in displacement settings.

	These findings from refugee populations have relevance for understanding mental health literacy within Iraq itself, where similar cultural beliefs and knowledge gaps likely exist but may be compounded by limited access to accurate health information and the ongoing effects of conflict and displacement.

## C. Medication Adherence: Patterns and Determinants

### 1. Theoretical Models of Medication Adherence

	Medication adherence can be defined as the extent to which a patient's behavior corresponds with the prescribed medication dosing regime, including time, dosing, and interval of medication intake (Gast & Mathes, 2019). Non-adherence negatively affects the efficacy, safety, and costs of therapies and is particularly problematic in chronic conditions requiring long-term treatment, including psychiatric disorders.

	A comprehensive overview of systematic reviews identified factors that influence adherence to oral medications in patients with chronic diseases (Gast & Mathes, 2019). The factors examined included socioeconomic factors (education, employment, financial status, marital status, social support), therapy-related factors (intake complexity, duration of therapy), disease-related factors (duration of disease, comorbidity), patient-related factors (age, gender, ethnic status), and healthcare system-related factors (co-payments, medication costs, insurance status).

	The overview found that socioeconomic status and social support might have a positive impact on adherence, while belonging to an ethnic minority might have a negative impact. Age may have a curvilinear relationship with adherence, with adherence being lowest in very young and very old patients. Depression has a consistent negative impact on adherence, a finding with particular relevance for psychiatric treatment where the condition itself may undermine the ability to adhere to prescribed regimens (Gast & Mathes, 2019).

	Therapy-related factors such as intake regime and disease-related factors such as duration of illness mostly showed no clear impact on adherence when examined across multiple conditions. However, co-payments (whether any or higher amounts) consistently showed a negative impact on adherence, while the impacts of medication costs and insurance status were uncertain (Gast & Mathes, 2019). These findings suggest that financial barriers to medication access represent a significant and modifiable determinant of adherence.

	Several theoretical models have been developed to explain and predict medication adherence. The Health Belief Model proposes that adherence decisions are influenced by perceived susceptibility to illness consequences, perceived severity of those consequences, perceived benefits of treatment, and perceived barriers to treatment. The Theory of Planned Behavior emphasizes the role of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in shaping intentions to adhere. Leventhal's self-regulatory model suggests that adherence depends on whether the patient perceives the treatment as making "common sense" in light of their personal beliefs about the illness and their experiences with symptoms and treatment (Horne et al., 1999).

	These theoretical frameworks have been applied to measurement tools such as the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, which operationalizes key constructs influencing adherence decisions. The BMQ's necessity-concerns framework has proven useful for predicting adherence across multiple chronic conditions, including psychiatric disorders. Patients who perceive high necessity for their medication and have low concerns are most likely to be adherent, while those with low perceived necessity and high concerns are most likely to be non-adherent (Horne et al., 1999).

### 2. Adherence in Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders

	Medication adherence in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders presents particular challenges due to the nature of these conditions. Interventions to improve medication adherence in schizophrenia have been systematically reviewed, with findings indicating that both psychoeducational and behavioral approaches can enhance adherence (Zygmunt et al., 2002). Effective interventions typically address knowledge deficits, build skills for managing medication regimens, involve family members in treatment, and address specific barriers identified through individual assessment.

	The importance of medication adherence in schizophrenia is underscored by evidence linking non-adherence to relapse, hospitalization, and poor long-term outcomes. Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT) for schizophrenia, which combines cognitive rehabilitation with social skills training, has been evaluated as an approach to improving overall treatment engagement and outcomes (Roder, 2006). Such integrated approaches recognize that adherence is influenced by multiple factors, including cognitive impairments that may affect the ability to manage complex medication regimens.

### 3. Stigma as a Barrier to Adherence

	The relationship between stigma and medication adherence operates through multiple pathways. Self-stigma—the internalization of negative societal attitudes—has been directly linked to reduced medication adherence in multiple studies. Research among patients with mental illness in Ethiopia found that those with higher levels of self-stigma were significantly less likely to adhere to prescribed psychiatric medications (Abdisa et al., 2020). This relationship persisted after controlling for other factors known to affect adherence.

	Self-stigma may affect adherence through its impact on treatment engagement and self-care behaviors. Individuals who believe that they are to blame for their mental illness or that mental illness reflects a personal weakness may be less motivated to take medication or may experience taking medication as a daily reminder of their stigmatized status. Additionally, concerns about being identified as mentally ill may lead individuals to avoid taking medication in situations where others might observe them.

	Research among Syrian refugees in Turkey demonstrated significant associations between psychiatric symptoms, medication adherence, and psychosocial functioning (Dikeç & Timarcıoğlu, 2023). The study found that medication adherence was influenced by multiple factors including symptom severity, access to healthcare, and social support. Refugee populations face particular challenges in maintaining medication adherence due to disrupted healthcare access, limited resources, and the psychological impacts of displacement.

### 4. Pediatric and Adolescent Medication Adherence

	Medication adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric conditions presents unique challenges that differ from adult populations. A systematic review of parental factors associated with child or adolescent medication adherence identified multiple influences, including parental knowledge about the condition and treatment, parental mental health, family functioning, and practical barriers such as cost and access (Kalaman et al., 2023).

	The initiation and adherence to psychotropic medication in pediatric populations involves complex interactions between parents, children, and healthcare providers (Hamrin et al., 2010). Parents serve as gatekeepers for their children's mental health treatment, and their beliefs and attitudes about psychiatric medication significantly influence whether treatment is initiated and maintained. Factors influencing parental decisions include beliefs about the causes of the child's problems, prior experiences with mental health treatment, information received from healthcare providers, and input from family members and peers.

	The consequences of untreated or inadequately treated mental health problems in children and adolescents are significant and include poorer academic performance, increased peer problems, elevated suicide risk, and significant stress on family functioning (Hamrin et al., 2010). These consequences underscore the importance of addressing barriers to medication initiation and adherence in this population.

## D. Psychiatric Medication Categories and Usage Patterns

### 1. Antipsychotic Medications: Prescribing Patterns in MENA

	Antipsychotic medications form a cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Clinical guidelines recommend antipsychotic monotherapy at the lowest effective dose, reserving high-dose therapy only for treatment-resistant cases after trials of two different antipsychotics and clozapine have failed (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026). However, prescribing patterns in clinical practice often deviate from these evidence-based recommendations.

	A study of antipsychotic prescribing patterns in Qatar found variations in prescribing practices, including rates of polypharmacy and use of high-dose antipsychotic therapy (Ouanes et al., 2020). Such patterns have been observed across multiple settings and reflect the complexity of managing treatment-resistant psychotic disorders as well as systemic factors influencing prescribing behavior.

	The evidence base for antipsychotic medication efficacy comes from extensive clinical trials and meta-analyses. A multiple-treatments meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia found meaningful differences between medications in terms of both efficacy and side effect profiles (Leucht et al., 2013). These differences have implications for treatment selection, as matching medication characteristics to patient preferences and needs may improve both adherence and outcomes.

	The physical health consequences of antipsychotic medication use represent an important consideration for prescribers and patients. A review of the literature on physical illness and schizophrenia documented increased rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome among patients with schizophrenia, with antipsychotic medications contributing to some of this excess morbidity (Leucht et al., 2007). Balancing the benefits of symptom control against the risks of metabolic side effects requires ongoing monitoring and, in some cases, medication adjustments.

### 2. Polypharmacy and High-Dose Therapy: Clinical Considerations

	Polypharmacy—the concurrent use of multiple psychiatric medications—and high-dose therapy raise important safety and effectiveness considerations. High-dose antipsychotic therapy is associated with increased risk of sedation, extrapyramidal side effects, metabolic complications, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of sudden cardiac death approximately doubles in patients receiving high doses compared to those on low doses (Nassr & Wadeea, 2026).

	The persistence of polypharmacy and high-dose prescribing despite guideline recommendations reflects multiple factors, including the challenges of managing treatment-resistant conditions, limited availability of clozapine and other evidence-based alternatives, and systemic factors such as formulary restrictions and prescriber training. Quality improvement initiatives targeting prescribing patterns have shown promise in some settings but require sustained effort and institutional support.

### 3. Pediatric Psychotropic Prescribing

	Psychotropic medication use among children and adolescents has increased substantially in recent decades, raising questions about appropriate prescribing practices and the balance of benefits and risks in this population. The decision to prescribe psychotropic medications to children involves careful consideration of developmental factors, the evidence base for specific medications in pediatric populations, and the preferences of parents and, where appropriate, the child (Hamrin et al., 2010).

	Research on mental health trends in military pediatric populations has documented patterns of service utilization and treatment for children of military families (Hisle-Gorman et al., 2019). These populations face particular stressors related to parental deployment, family relocation, and potential parental injury or death. Understanding treatment patterns in these populations provides insights into how psychotropic medications are used in response to specific stressor exposures.

## E. Impact of War, Conflict, and Trauma on Mental Health

### 1. Historical Context: Mental Healthcare Through Conflicts

	The relationship between armed conflict and mental health has been extensively documented, with war and political violence contributing to elevated rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions among both military and civilian populations. The mental healthcare systems in conflict-affected regions often face simultaneous increases in demand and decreases in capacity, as infrastructure is damaged, healthcare workers flee or are displaced, and resources are diverted to acute needs.

	The historical evolution of mental healthcare through periods of conflict provides context for understanding current challenges. In Iraq, decades of war and sanctions contributed to the deterioration of mental health services, with the number of psychiatrists declining from already low levels and infrastructure suffering repeated damage. Similar patterns have been documented in other conflict-affected countries, where the burden of mental illness increases precisely when the capacity to address it diminishes.

### 2. Combat-Related Mental Health: Military Populations

	Research on combat-related mental health problems has been most extensively conducted among US and coalition forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. A landmark study found that rates of PTSD, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder were significantly higher among soldiers returning from combat duty compared to pre-deployment levels (Hoge et al., 2004). Importantly, the study also documented significant barriers to care, including concerns about stigma that prevented many soldiers with mental health problems from seeking treatment.

	Among soldiers meeting screening criteria for a mental health disorder, only 23% to 40% reported receiving any professional help in the past year (Hoge et al., 2004). The most commonly reported barriers were concerns about being stigmatized, including worries about being seen as weak by peers and leaders, concerns about potential career consequences, and distrust of mental health professionals. These findings led to significant reforms in military mental health care delivery, including efforts to reduce stigma and improve access to services (Hoge et al., 2016).

	A systematic review of PTSD relapse among veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan documented the chronic and recurring nature of combat-related trauma (Berge et al., 2020). Even among veterans who initially respond to treatment, relapse rates remain substantial, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and support. These findings have implications for treatment planning and resource allocation in both military and civilian settings.

	The transformation of mental health care for US soldiers and families during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars represented a significant policy response to documented needs (Hoge et al., 2016). Reforms included embedding mental health professionals with combat units, developing programs to reduce stigma and encourage help-seeking, and improving coordination between military and civilian healthcare systems. These reforms, while developed in a military context, offer lessons for civilian healthcare systems in conflict-affected regions.

### 3. Barriers to Mental Healthcare in Conflict Settings

	Barriers to mental healthcare in conflict settings operate at multiple levels. Structural barriers include damaged infrastructure, shortage of trained providers, limited medication availability, and disrupted healthcare financing. Individual-level barriers include stigma, lack of knowledge about mental health, and competing priorities related to physical safety and basic survival needs.

	The challenge of providing mental healthcare in conflict settings has generated interest in task-shifting approaches, where less specialized providers are trained to deliver basic mental health interventions. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrating mental health services in primary care in low- and middle-income countries has been reviewed, with evidence supporting this approach as a way to expand access while reducing stigma (Cubillos et al., 2021).

## F. Healthcare System Challenges in Iraq

### 1. Structure of Mental Health Services in Iraq

	The structure of mental health services varies considerably across the MENA region, with implications for access, quality, and acceptability of care. Most countries in the region have experienced historical underinvestment in mental health, with services concentrated in large psychiatric hospitals rather than integrated into primary care (Okasha et al., 2025). Recent reforms in several countries have aimed to shift care toward community-based models, though progress has been uneven.

	The World Health Organization has recommended that mental health services be integrated into general health services to reduce stigma, improve access, and ensure that mental health problems associated with physical conditions are appropriately addressed. In Kuwait, this recommendation has been endorsed as a strategy to overcome the stigma associated with visiting dedicated psychiatric facilities (Almazeedi & Alsuwaidan, 2014). Similar arguments apply in other MENA countries where cultural factors make visits to psychiatric hospitals socially unacceptable.

### 2. Alternative and Traditional Healing Practices

	Traditional healers play a significant role in mental health support across the MENA region, offering religious-based interventions where formal healthcare access is limited or stigmatized (Okasha et al., 2025). In many Arab countries, a substantial portion of individuals with mental disorders initially seek advice from traditional healers before turning to formal healthcare. Traditional healing often involves rituals to exorcise spirits believed to cause mental illness, aligning with cultural beliefs in possession and supernatural causes.

	Research on lay beliefs regarding causes of mental illness in sub-Saharan Africa found that supernatural factors (witchcraft, evil spirits, God's will, destiny) and substance misuse were the most commonly endorsed causes, while biological factors were less frequently endorsed (Adewuya & Makanjuola, 2008). These beliefs influence treatment-seeking behavior, with individuals who attribute mental illness to supernatural causes being more likely to seek traditional rather than biomedical treatment. Education and familiarity with mental illness were associated with greater endorsement of biological and psychosocial causes, while older age and rural residence were associated with belief in supernatural causation (Adewuya & Makanjuola, 2008).

	The coexistence of traditional healing and conventional medicine creates both challenges and opportunities. Patients may delay or avoid evidence-based treatment while seeking traditional interventions, potentially worsening outcomes. However, traditional healers may also serve as entry points to the healthcare system if appropriate referral pathways are established. Some countries have explored integrating the roles of religious and traditional healers into formal medical care, though the evidence base for such integration remains limited.

### 3. Integration of Mental Health in Primary Care

	The integration of mental health services into primary care has been proposed as a solution to multiple challenges facing mental healthcare systems in low-resource settings. A systematic review of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this approach found evidence supporting integration as a way to improve access, reduce stigma, and ensure appropriate treatment of mental disorders associated with physical conditions (Cubillos et al., 2021).

	A qualitative study of mental health stigma at primary health care centers in Lebanon examined the experiences of healthcare providers, policy makers, and patients (Abi Hana et al., 2022). The study found that stigma operated at multiple levels, with patients reporting experiencing overt stigmatizing behavior in the community but less explicit discrimination in primary care settings. The findings emphasized the importance of combating structural stigma through legal reform, addressing interpersonal stigma through provider training, committing primary care management to deliver high-quality integrated mental health services, and reducing intrapersonal stigma by building public empathy (Abi Hana et al., 2022).

## G. Special Populations and Vulnerable Groups

### 1. University Students and Young Adults

	Young adults, including university students, represent an important population for mental health intervention given that many psychiatric disorders have their onset during adolescence and early adulthood. Research from the MENA region has documented significant prevalence of mental health problems among university students, along with gaps in help-seeking and treatment.

	Mental health stigma among university students has been examined across multiple Arab countries. Research indicates that stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness are common among students, with implications for both personal help-seeking and future professional practice among those training for healthcare careers. Educational interventions targeting students may have multiplier effects by improving attitudes among future healthcare providers and community members.

### 2. Women's Mental Health

	Women in conflict-affected settings face particular mental health risks related to gender-based violence, loss of family members, displacement, and restricted access to services. Research on the mental health of women in Iraq has documented high rates of trauma exposure and psychiatric symptoms, with barriers to care including stigma, lack of female providers, and cultural restrictions on women's mobility and autonomy (Younis, 2015; Younis & Lafta, 2021).

	Research on trauma and perceived social rejection among Yazidi women and girls who survived enslavement and genocide documented profound psychological impacts of these experiences (Ibrahim et al., 2018). Survivors faced not only symptoms related to their traumatic experiences but also rejection and stigmatization within their own communities, compounding their psychological distress. These findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive interventions that address both individual trauma and community-level attitudes.

### 3. Children and Adolescents

	Children and adolescents in conflict-affected settings are exposed to multiple risk factors for mental health problems, including direct exposure to violence, loss of family members, displacement, disrupted education, and the psychological impacts of living with traumatized parents and caregivers. Research has documented elevated rates of mental disorders among children in conflict-affected regions, with implications for development, education, and long-term functioning.

	Parental factors play a critical role in determining whether children receive appropriate mental health treatment. Research has identified multiple parental influences on medication adherence, including parental knowledge, beliefs, mental health, and practical barriers (Kalaman et al., 2023). Interventions to improve pediatric mental health treatment outcomes must therefore address parental factors alongside child-focused approaches.

### 4. Refugees and Displaced Populations

	Refugees and internally displaced persons face particular challenges in maintaining mental health and accessing appropriate treatment. Displacement disrupts established healthcare relationships, creates barriers to medication continuity, and exposes individuals to additional stressors related to loss, uncertainty, and adaptation to new environments.

	Research among Syrian refugees has documented high rates of psychiatric symptoms and challenges in maintaining medication adherence (Dikeç & Timarcıoğlu, 2023). Similar challenges likely affect internally displaced populations within Iraq and Iraqi refugees in other countries. Interventions to support mental health in displaced populations must address practical barriers to care access while also building mental health literacy and reducing stigma.

## H. Healthcare Provider Perspectives and Roles

### 1. Attitudes of Healthcare Professionals Toward Mental Illness

	Healthcare providers' attitudes toward mental illness can significantly influence the quality of care received by patients with psychiatric conditions. Research has shown that healthcare providers may hold stigmatizing attitudes similar to those found in the general population, with potential negative effects on patient care (Booth et al., 2024).

	A study of nurses' attitudes toward patients with mental illness in a general hospital in Kuwait found that while nurses generally held positive attitudes, there was room for improvement, particularly regarding social restrictiveness and beliefs about the causes of mental illness (Al-Awadhi et al., 2017). The study highlighted the importance of education and contact with patients with mental illness in shaping provider attitudes.

	Healthcare providers in conservative communities face a particular dilemma when their professional training conflicts with cultural beliefs prevalent in their communities (Booth et al., 2024). Providers may need support in reconciling evidence-based practice with cultural sensitivity, and healthcare systems may need to create environments where providers feel able to deliver appropriate mental health care without social or professional consequences.

### 2. Role of Pharmacists in Mental Healthcare

	Pharmacists occupy a unique position in the healthcare system as the most accessible healthcare professionals and the final link in the medication use process. Community pharmacists have regular contact with patients taking psychiatric medications and can play important roles in medication counseling, adherence support, and identification of medication-related problems.

	Research on pharmacist attitudes toward collaboration with general practitioners has identified factors that facilitate or impede interprofessional collaboration in medication management (Van et al., 2012). Collaborative relationships between pharmacists and prescribers can improve medication safety and effectiveness, including in mental health care.

	Student pharmacist engagement in medication management has been evaluated as a model for expanding pharmacy involvement in patient care (Herbert et al., 2020). Such programs can build skills and confidence among future pharmacists while also expanding the capacity of healthcare systems to provide medication-related services.

	In the Iraqi context, pharmacists often serve as the first point of healthcare contact for individuals with health concerns, including mental health symptoms. This gate-keeping role creates both opportunities and responsibilities for appropriate screening, referral, and medication counseling. Pharmacist knowledge and attitudes regarding mental health and psychiatric medications therefore have significant implications for the quality of care received by patients.
