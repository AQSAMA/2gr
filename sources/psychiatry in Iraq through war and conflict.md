Abstract
Across four decades of war and violence in Iraq between 1981 and 2003, I undertook my medical training in psychiatry. I chose this
specialty in response to the suffering of the bereaved women in Iraq across these rough times. This article details a personal history
of my journey specialising in psychiatry through this period in Iraq and the experience of being the first female psychiatrist who
accomplished her training through the Iraqi Board of Psychiatry in a programme established in 1988. I reflect on how psychiatry was
not the specialisation of choice for female doctors, which created a shortage in the field. This most acutely impacted female trauma
victims, who preferred to be treated by female psychiatrists. From the 1950s to 1988, the ratio of psychiatrists in the country increased
from 0.2 to 0.5 per 100,000 population. However, this saw a dramatic decrease because of two waves of migration in 1991 and 2003,
as of 1998, the ratio of psychiatrists in the country had dropped to 0.1 per 100,000 of the population. The pursuit and development of
this specialisation were disrupted by war, invasion and comprehensive sanctions. I also consider the socio-economic impact of these
aforementioned events on society as a whole and, in particular, on the medical profession. This account tells the story of my lived
experience during those difficult times and my efforts to become an example of a new generation of women psychiatrists.

BACKGROUND
The Iraqi government was first established at the end of the
period of British occupation (1917–1921). During the subsequent
years of political unrest between 1921 and the establishment of
the fully independent Iraqi kingdom in 1932, many institutions
have laid their foundations, such as the military, the ministry
of education and higher educational institutions. Most notable
was the establishment of the oldest medical school in the
country, Baghdad Medical College. Baghdad Medical College
was founded by a British military physician, Sir HC Sanderson,
with the assistance from young Iraqi doctors. Shortly after, the
first mental hospital (Dar Al-Shefaa) was founded in 1922 to
provide custodial services to patients with severe mental illness
and poor primitive healthcare. The modern concept of mental
health service training and teaching was not introduced until
1934 by the pioneer Jewish psychiatrist, Dr. J Aboad.
The introduction of government-funded scholarships for
training and specialisation in psychiatry abroad has increased
the number of Iraqi psychiatrists; by 1940, the country had in

total 15 specialised psychiatrists, which represented a ratio of
0.2 per 100,000 (Younis, 2009a).
In the following decades, efforts on establishing and developing
mental health services had proliferated. This was represented in
the establishment of the sizeable 1300-bed psychiatric hospital
(Al-Rashad) in 1953 on the periphery of Baghdad, followed
by another 70-bed psychiatric hospital (Ibn Rushd) for acute
mental disorders (Younis, 2009b). In 1970, the mental health
service in Iraq was augmented upon the establishment of the
Iraqi Association of Neurologists and Psychiatrists.
The start of the Iran–Iraq war, 1980–1988, marked the
beginning of the deterioration of psychiatric development in
Iraq; the government scholarship programme to train Iraqi
psychiatrists aboard was suspended, and the shortages in the
health budget deprived many psychiatric centres of expansion
and development. The availability of human resources declined
because of the recruitment of many graduate doctors into military
service. This decline in mental health care services worsened
after the gulf war of 1991. The damage did not only stem from

the violence of the short 40-day war but from the years of more
severe comprehensive economic sanctions, 1990–2003, which
had impacted the poorest segment of the population hardest.
The international sanctions imposed by the United Nations
during this period had led to shortages of crucial medicines and
brain drained the country of its most experienced psychiatrists.
This has markedly disrupted the practice of psychiatry. The
destruction of power and service stations, roads and bridges and
telecommunications by the continuous bombardment from 17
to 22 February resulted in the paralysis of the healthcare system
in general. The number of psychiatric attendees at outpatient
clinics increased from 197,000 in 1990 to 220,000 in 1994 and
further rose to 507,000 in 1998. The majority of whom suffered
post-traumatic stress disorders (WHO, 2005, 2006). The total
number of psychiatrists was around 108 in 2001 and dropped to
90 in 2003 (Younis, 2009b, 2008).
A significant blow to the mental health system occurred in
March 2003 by the US-led military invasion and occupation of
Iraq, when acts of violence, looting and vandalism lead to a new
wave of brain drain (Burnham et al., 2006). Around 10% of the
Iraqi population were estimated to be affected by psychiatric
disorders (WHO, 2006).
BASIC TRAINING
The first time I encountered a patient with mental illness was in
1979. I was a fifth-year medical student at the Mosul University,
attending my first clinical psychiatric session. During the
session, I was introduced to electroconvulsive therapy
(ECT). It was administered with intravenous diazepam to an
agitated psychotic patient. My tutor, who was a pioneer female
psychiatrist, asked: ‘How many of you wish to be a psychiatrist?’
None of us replied, Yes.
In Mosul Medical School, the psychiatric unit was established
in the early 1960s by Dr. F Al-Dabbag, who was a pioneer
psychiatrist in the city and later became the dean of Mosul
Medical School. Through his efforts to develop a modern
psychiatric department, he inspired several interns to choose
psychiatry as a career. Some of them later secured governmentfunded scholarships to train in the United Kingdom and obtain
FRCPsych (Younis, 2008).
Female doctors rarely pursued psychiatry specialty in Iraq
(Younis et al., 2016). However, my tutor, Dr. Najat Al-Saffar,
who was the first qualified female psychiatrist in Iraq, was
fiercely dedicated to the profession. She inspired me early on to
pursue it as a future specialisation.
114

I graduated from Mosul Medical College in 1981 at the start
of the Iraq–Iran war, 1980–1988. As an intern, I witnessed
the impact of war-related traumas on families. It is estimated
that one million people in Iraq were dead, severely wounded,
or imprisoned during this war. The conflict deprived Iraq of
young working men, who were recruited for the war, including
medical graduates and specialised doctors, some of whom
spent 5 years in the military. The recruitment of young medical
workforce to the army caused a profound shortage of men in
hospitals, especially young doctors and, in turn, increased the
workload on female doctors in the country. The newly imposed
long duty hours on the interns mounted to 1 day off per week.
After completing the foundation year in three general hospitals
in Baghdad in 1982, I was deployed by the Ministry of Health
to work in the rural village of Kubaysah, Anbar province,
180 km west of Baghdad. This was in accordance with the
Ministry of Health’s regulation of deploying medical residents
to work in rural areas for 1 year during their training as general
practitioners. Kubaysah village was a natural habitat for jackals
and hyenas. Their nightly yowling had caused me insomnia
and distress. House amenities, that is, hot water, heating and
cooling systems, were inadequate. I worked with two general
practitioners in the rural outpatient clinic and was allowed one
weekend off per month to travel to my family in Baghdad.
At the end of that year, when my time was nearing to return to
Baghdad, I began to contemplate psychiatry as a career. On a
surprise visit in 1983 by Iraq’s Health Minister Dr. Sadiq Alwash
to inspect the quality of healthcare centres in Anbar province,
he expressed his admiration at our diligence and dedication
to provide quality healthcare in Kubaysah. The commitment
to quality service was echoed throughout the country despite
the human and financial cost of the ongoing Iraq–Iran war.
The World Health Organization (WHO) had acknowledged
Iraq’s healthcare system as one of the best in the Middle East
region at the time (EMRO, 2006). Dr. Alwash asked what my
future interest for specialisation and promised to consider my
ambition for specialising in psychiatry in the United Kingdom,
as part of the government-funded scholarships.
TRAINING IN PSYCHIATRY
In Baghdad, Ibn Rushd leading mental hospital was founded
by the Ministry of Health in Baghdad 1968 and contained 70
beds, including 12 beds for patients with substance misuse
disorder. The hospital was adequately equipped and included
a consultation clinic for treatment and follow-up. There
was a unit specialised for child psychiatry. It also included a
special team for modified ECT and a specialised department

GLOBAL PSYCHIATRY — Vol 3 | Issue 2 | 2020

for social workers and psychologists. There was a special
department for patients’ leisure activities and a pharmacy
distributing free of charge medicines. There were 10
private rooms in total. By standards of the time in Iraq, this
psychiatric hospital was a top-tier treatment centre. I joined
Ibn Rushd Mental Hospital to start training in November
1983. On my first day of enrolment, I was disappointed when
the administration gave me one of patient’s private rooms
to reside in, as the hospital only had a dormitory for male
doctors. The director told me that I was the first female
resident attending the hospital, and there were only four
female psychiatrists in the country. I had no choice but to
take this patient’s residence for the first year.
The workload was distributed between one or two incumbent
foundation doctors. The hospital regulation entailed only 1
day off per week. There were only five female and three male
nurses serving the patients in the entire hospital. Two of the
male nurses were exempted from army service because of their
disability, where most male nurses in the country were enrolled
for compulsory army service. The rest of the administrative
staffs were all female employees with a few old male employees
who were spared military service. We used the doctor’s hall for
inpatient consultation. There were three qualified consultants,
who started the rounds early in the morning, accompanied by
me, the resident doctor, the nurse, and the social worker. In
the evening, I began the rounds with the resident doctor and
the nurse. There was no outpatient service after hours, and the
hospital administration was assigned to me.
The doctor’s hall was used for meals, reading and television
entertainment, which was restricted to displaying war news and
political events. Our food was limited and rationed. I stayed
in this hospital for a year; the last month, I was continuously
on duty because the male interns were summoned to the
army. I then complained to the manager for 1 day off to see my
family, and he helped me by assigning one resident from the
nearby OB/GYN hospital to cover my duties for only 12 hours
during which I could visit my family. After a while, the Ibn
Rushd Hospital had become my home. I stayed in the hospital
throughout the week, enjoying my work with the patients and
learning the skill of the profession.
At the end of 1984, I moved to Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital to
continue my training in the psychiatric department for another
year. I was happier there because of my private residence in
the female doctors’ dormitory. The psychiatric unit had been
established in 1977, built for patients psychiatric disorder. It
contained 40 beds and an outpatient clinic, a pharmacy and a
unit for modified ECT (Younis, 2008). There were four MRC

Psych qualified consultants, one intern and myself as the only
registrar.
At the end of 1985, I was transferred to Ba’qoba General Hospital
in Diala province, 70 km east of Baghdad, where I worked as a
psychiatric practitioner. After 2 years, I was assigned the role
of a specialist psychiatrist. My daily work was in a walk-in
psychiatric outpatient clinic with no night duty. Emergency
cases were referred to the general hospital. I stayed there until
the end of 1988 when the war finally stopped, and the ceasefire
declared on 8 August 1988. I was overwhelmed, as everyone
was, for this news. This represented the possibility of obtaining
a qualification in psychiatry abroad as borders would open, and
the government-imposed travel ban will be lifted.
JOURNEY FOR QUALIFICATION
The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research
founded the Iraqi Council for Medical Specializations (ICMS)
in 1986 to start a national postgraduate training programme as
an alternative strategy for overseas education. In October 1988,
I joined the first batch of 10 trainees to obtain the degree of
the Iraqi Fellowship (FICM Psych), the programme involved
rotation in four teaching hospitals in Baghdad, and we were
enthusiastic about being educated in this specialty. Our
hospital duties became more scheduled and more organised
with weekly seminars and tutorials, and I was assigned to edit a
research work for the first time in my life (Al Jadiry et al., 1994).
After 2 years, Our training in this programme was disrupted
by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on 1 August 1990. A few days
later, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) imposed
a comprehensive trade embargo on Iraq as a political
punishment, which was a unique measure in its history
(UNSC, 1995). A new wave of military recruitment started,
and the travel ban was imposed again. The economic
sanctions caused the severe collapse of the Iraqi currency,
Iraqi Dinar, debasing the currency to 1/800th of its original
value (The Harvard Study Team, 1991). The sanctions affected
all sectors of life, in general, targeting the necessary needs of
people, food and medicines (Al-Nasrawi, 2001). Our monthly
wages had dropped to what would be equal to $1–2 US dollars
at the time, 3000 Iraqi Dinars in 1991. People were struck
economically, and there was a shortage of psychiatric drugs
causing deterioration of the mental health system. Supply
of new and imported psychiatric medications stopped, and
the only source of medicines came through the state’s drug
factory, Sammeraa Drug Industry (SDI), with some donations
from international organisations (Younis and Aswad,
2017). Because of the financial hardships, some consultant
115

psychiatrists chose to leave Iraq for a better life elsewhere. The
number of psychiatrists per general population dropped from
0.5/100,000 population before 1990 to 0.1/100,000 population
in 1998. Furthermore, per 100,000 population, there were
seven psychiatric beds in hospitals, 0.1 nurses and 0.02
psychologists and social workers (Okasha et al.,2012).
Psychiatrists were burdened by the resultant workload of
an increased number of war traumatised patients. This is
also reflected by the WHO reporting an increased number
of attendees to the psychiatric clinics in the state hospitals
from 197,000 patients in 1990 to 507,000 in 1998 (Okasha et
al., 2012). In my study, the total number of patients attending
the Neuropsychiatric Outpatient Clinic in the Medical City
Teaching Hospital during the year 1993 was 10,200, which
reflects a considerable number during sanction’s years (Younis
and Lafta, 2014).
On 17 January 1991, the US-led allied forces carried out a
military invasion to expel the Iraqi army from Kuwait, killing an
estimated number of 82,000 military and civilian personnel and
destroying many infrastructure establishments: bridges, roads,
power and water stations. Thus, the health system was severely
affected. There was continuous bombardment on Baghdad
and other governorates with an estimated total of 120,000 raids
(Younis and Aswad, 2017). During this tumultuous time, I was
reallocated to Ibn Rushd Hospital again, where I first trained
for specialisation 8 years before. We were firmly instructed to
stay inside the hospital to deal with all incoming emergencies.
There was no electricity, and no telecommunication, food
quality was poor and rationed. We received assistance from the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for food and
medicine delivery.
Following the truce between the allied forces and the
government officials on February 22, public uprisings began
to erupt, which increased the chaos and human casualties
(Younis, 2003a). I was struggling to concentrate on my studies
and training under these insecure circumstances. However,
only 2 months later, life became quiescent again, and the
government began efforts to replenish hospitals; I was allowed
to continue my postgraduate training at Al-Rashad long-stay
mental hospital.
Al-Rashad Mental Hospital was established in 1953, containing
1300 beds; some 100 of them were for the detainees for
forensic assessment (Younis, 2009b). Then I enrolled in the
Neuropsychiatric Department in the Medical City Teaching
Hospital for another 6 months. By then, I finished my training
and obtained the fellowship (FICM Psych) in September 1992, I
116

was appointed as a psychiatric specialist in my former hospital
once more, Ibn Rushd Hospital.
In January 1995, I was elected to join the academic staff of
Baghdad College of Medicine, and I was the first woman
tutoring psychiatry in the college. I enjoyed my job, especially
teaching medical students and doing my clinical practice in
the department. I married a gynaecologist in 1994 and had two
daughters.
MY JOURNEY TO THE PROFESSORSHIP
In October 2000, I went to Cairo to attend examination of
the Arab Board of Psychiatry, the journey proceeded through
road travel to Jordan and then flight from Amman to Cairo,
because air travel was banned in Iraq. I passed the examination
and was awarded the degree (CABM Psych). I then rejoined
my academic department and started research on the quality
of life amongst college students in Iraq. I was then renowned
by the university to be promoted to assistant professor in 2002
(Younis, 2003b).
On 21 March 2003, Iraq was invaded by the US-led allied
forces, and the country was struck by bombardment, killing
and injuring tens of thousands of military and civil personnel
(Burnham et al., 2006; Sharma and Piachaud, 2011). During
that extensive bombardment, I confined myself at home with
my family, the most memorable times of this campaign was the
first time we had seen invading US tank entering our street and
stationed at our entrance. It was a hard time for my family and
me to endure. Hospitals were closed except for emergency calls.
We realised then that Baghdad had ‘fallen’ and the government
was toppled.
There occurred a generalised disruption of law and order.
The Iraqi forces were dismantled, creating a security vacuum.
Following this, violence and armed conflict swept the country,
taking away hundreds of thousands of lives. Vandalism, theft and
kidnap prevailed in Baghdad and many other cities (Iraq Family
Health Survey Study Group, 2008). Amongst the lost lives,
there was an estimate of 140 doctors assassinated, including 5
psychiatrists (Younis, 2008; Al-Kinde, 2014). This situation cited
many doctors leaving the country abroad, depriving the medical
workforce in hospitals (Donaldson et al., 2012).
The situation of armed conflict and civil war continued for the
following years. The high number of casualties had taken a toll
on the health system’s ability to cope. In one incident in June
2006, corpses were being transferred to the mortuary adjoining
the medical college building where I worked; these bodies were

GLOBAL PSYCHIATRY — Vol 3 | Issue 2 | 2020

left to be claimed by their relatives. A cut in electric power
caused the fridges where the bodies were stored to stop working.
The corpses rotted because of the lack of electricity, and the foul
smell permeated through the college building. I was attending
the student’s examination in the lecture theatre, and all of us
were suddenly made uncomfortable by this foul smell.
During this period, my brother, an eye surgeon, was kidnapped,
along with two cousins of mine for ransom. I was overcome by
stress and decided to leave Baghdad for a safer place. I travelled
with my two children to Jordan on a road journey, leaving my
husband to his duties behind. In Jordan, I worked as a senior
lecturer in the psychiatric department at Jordan University of
Science and Technology, attending the outpatient clinic and
tutoring the fifth-year medical students 2006–2008.
At the end of 2008, the situation in Baghdad had relatively
improved, and sectarian violence diminished; I returned to
Baghdad, rejoining my academic department and organising
my home back in order again. Psychiatric services in Iraq
deteriorated after 2003 because of the brain drain and corruption
(Calisi, 2013) but gradually improved again after the war and
armed conflict stopped. The total number of patients attending
the psychiatric outpatient clinic in the Medical City Teaching
Hospital decreased to a minimum of 1,310 in 2003 compared to
10,200 and 2,979 patients in 1993 and 2010, respectively (Younis
&Al-Nuaimi, 2006; Younis et al.,2013).

around the web (Psychiatric Times, 2015), I was promoted
to a professorship in 2012 after publishing 36 papers in local
and international journals and attending about 40 local and
international conferences as a speaker.
This biography has been a summary of my journey in psychiatric
specialisation, from medical school to professorship. As I am
nearing my retirement, I hope I have exemplified the model
of woman psychiatrist to the younger generation of medical
students in Iraq, and the dedication of providing high-quality
healthcare during war and conflict. I hope I had paved the
way for more women to enrol in psychiatry, both locally and
internationally. Reflecting on personal history in scientific
journals is always a positive and unusual way to motivate
people to overcome life’s difficulties in achieving their goals
(Bhugra, 2019).

The most recent civil war against the Islamic State in Iraq
and Syria (ISIS), 2014–2017, caused a tragic influx of wartraumatised patients and forcibly displaced families who needed
psychiatric and social care (Horton, 2015). This created a need
for re-organising women’s mental health services because of
the mounting number of widows and orphans, preferring
women psychiatrists for cultural beliefs. The number of women
psychiatrists increased from 8 (7%) of 110 psychiatrists in 2001
to 44 (29%) of 160 psychiatrists in 2014 in Iraq.
