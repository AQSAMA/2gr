Background: Current evidence-based guidelines recommend the use of antipsychotic
monotherapy at the lowest effective dose. Nonetheless, high-dose antipsychotics and
antipsychotic polypharmacy appear to be common in clinical practice, often deviating from
established recommendations.
Aim: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with high-dose
antipsychotic prescribing among adult psychiatric inpatients.
Setting: The study was conducted at Ibn Rushd Psychiatric Teaching Hospital in Baghdad,
Iraq.
Methods: The medical records of inpatients admitted from 24 April 2023 to 12 September 2023,
were retrospectively analysed to extract routinely collected patient-level data and medication
details; dosing appropriateness was based on that stated in the British National Formulary.
Results: Of the 225 eligible patients, 51.1% were male, aged 18–82 years (mean = 33.9).
Altogether, 48.6% of patients received antipsychotic polypharmacy, and 35.6% were prescribed
high-dose antipsychotics. No significant associations were found between high-dose
antipsychotic prescribing and patients’ characteristics, including age, sex, length of hospital
stay, and number of admissions. Predictors of high-dose antipsychotics were polypharmacy
(adjusted odd ratio [AOR]:12.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78, 89.50), first-generation
antipsychotics (AOR: 7.049; 95% CI 1.33, 37.44), quetiapine (AOR: 5.66; 95% CI 1.16, 27.53),
procyclidine (AOR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.05, 0.55), and antidepressants (AOR: 0.19; 95% CI 0.05, 0.76).
Conclusion: Approximately one in three patients received regular high-dose antipsychotic
therapy, which contradicts optimal clinical practice and risks patient safety. Targeted
educational interventions are warranted to enhance guideline adherence and promote safe
and appropriate use of antipsychotics.
Contribution: This is the first study to assess the magnitude and factors associated with highdose antipsychotic prescription in Iraq.
Keywords: high-dose antipsychotics; antipsychotic polypharmacy; psychosis; audit;

Introduction
Antipsychotic medications constitute a critical intervention for acute and long-term
management of severe mental illness such as psychosis, bipolar disorder and treatmentresistant cases of major depressive disorder.1 However, these medications are associated with
serious adverse effects; therefore, clinical practice guidelines recommend principles of
rational prescribing and monitoring to enhance patient safety.2,3 Antipsychotic medications
are broadly divided into two categories: first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), which include
haloperidol, chlorpromazine and sulpride, and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs),
which include olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone.1 First-generation antipsychotics act
through dopamine receptor (D2) antagonism in the brain, whereas SGAs block serotonin
(5-HT2A) and dopamine (D2) neurotransmission.1

Evidence-based guidelines recommend antipsychotic monotherapy prescribed at the lowest
effective dose.2,3 The use of high-dose antipsychotic therapy, whether originating from single
or multiple medications, is not currently endorsed by guidelines.2,3 According to the American
Psychiatric Association and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, high-dose

http://www.sajpsychiatry.org

antipsychotic therapy is reserved as the last resort for the
management of treatment-resistant cases, which fail to
achieve optimal response to an adequate trial of two
antipsychotics from two different classes, and clozapine is
tried and is either ineffective or not tolerated.2,3
Despite guidelines recommendations, observational studies
show that prescription of antipsychotic polypharmacy and
high-dose antipsychotics appear to be common in clinical
practice.4 The prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy
among inpatients varies globally between 20% and 66%.4
According to a study in Australia, the rate of high-dose
antipsychotics is 27.0% among patients receiving compulsory
treatment in the community.5 Similarly, a recent study in
Italy reported a high rate of 50.8% among 730 forensic
psychiatric inpatients.6 Furthermore, a study in Cyprus
found that among 482 patients in psychiatric compulsory
care settings, the rate of high-dose prescription was 27.2%.7
High-dose prescribing has been linked to various factors
such as younger age, male gender, schizophrenia diagnosis,
inpatient status, greater number of admissions, longer
duration of hospital stay, prescription of antipsychotic
polypharmacy, long-acting antipsychotics, anticholinergics,
or FGAs.8,9
In acute adult psychiatric settings, antipsychotic
polypharmacy, a key contributor to high-dose prescribing, is
often used to stabilise patients with behavioural disturbances,
promote rapid control of symptoms, and return the patient to
baseline level of functioning.10 However, according to
neuroimaging studies, increasing the dose does not
necessarily increase the clinical response rates.11 Side effects
of antipsychotics are dose-related.12 Therefore, increasing the
dose increases the frequency and severity of side effects such
as sedation, hypotension, extrapyramidal side effects,
hyperprolactinaemia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome,
seizure, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death.12 Thus,
because of the potential harm associated with high-dose
antipsychotic prescribing, physical and metabolic health
monitoring has become a key performance indicator for
patients receiving high-dose in the United Kingdom, North
America, and Australia.13
Patients with severe mental illness exhibit a reduced life
expectancy compared to the general population, which is
attributed, in part, to the prescription of combined and
high-dose antipsychotics.9 High-dose antipsychotics
increase the risk of adverse drug events such that the
incidence of sudden cardiac death is approximately
doubled in patients receiving high doses compared to those
receiving low doses.8,14 Furthermore, recent evidence
indicates that antipsychotic dose reduction in patients with
schizophrenia led to improvement in cognitive function
without an increase in the risk of relapse.15 Evaluation of
high-dose antipsychotic prescription trends can assess
adherence to prescription guidelines and inform
policymakers on implementing strategies to optimise
treatment outcomes. Most of the evidence related to

high-dose antipsychotic prescribing is derived from studies
conducted in developed countries; studies evaluating the
magnitude of high-dose antipsychotic prescribing in Iraq
are currently lacking. We aim to address this gap in the
literature by determining the prevalence and predictors of
high-dose antipsychotic therapy among adult psychiatric
inpatients in Baghdad, Iraq.

Research methods and design
Study design and setting

This study was an observational cross-sectional analysis of
adult patients who received inpatient psychiatric care at the
Ibn Rushd Psychiatric Teaching Hospital in Baghdad. This
psychiatric hospital has delivered outpatient and inpatient
mental health services since 1968 and is one of the two
mental health hospitals in Iraq. The outpatient department
is divided into four specialised units catering to distinct
patient populations: children, adults, the elderly, and those
with substance abuse issues, with an average of 150 patient
consultations per working day. The inpatient department
comprises six psychiatric wards with 48 beds and two
substance abuse wards with 16 beds. The hospital employs
an electronic database system, where each patient is
assigned a unique healthcare number, enabling researchers
to access information on inpatient admissions and
outpatient visits using this identifier. Reporting of the study
findings was guided by adhering to the Strengthening the
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) guidelines.16

Study population and data collection
Convenience sampling was employed to extract the
information of patients receiving antipsychotic therapy
during admission from 24 April 2023 to 12 September 2023.
No sample size calculation was necessary because we
included all patients admitted during the study period.
All adult patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia
and related psychotic disorders, mood disorders, or
substance abuse receiving antipsychotic medication(s)
were included. Patients under 18 years old, those with
neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, or
personality disorders were excluded. The researcher
reviewed 245 patient records; 20 were excluded because of
age (n = 11), no antipsychotic medication prescribed (n = 4),
neurological diseases (n = 4), and personality disorder
(n = 1), leaving 225 patients eligible for inclusion. If there
were multiple admissions during the study period, the
first admission was considered. Given the exploratory
nature of the study, teaching commitment of the first
author, and resource implications, a sample size of
225 patients was deemed appropriate to represent the
prescription pattern at the site.
The data collected included sociodemographic information
such as age and sex, clinical information including
psychiatric diagnosis and readmissions during the study

period, and medication information such as medication
name, total daily dose, and route of administration. This
information was extracted from the electronic medical
records by one experienced clinical pharmacist. The data
were then entered into Excel, cleaned, and transferred to
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis.

Measurement of outcomes
The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of high-dose
antipsychotic therapy. The British National Formulary (BNF)
was consulted to determine the maximum doses for
antipsychotics. The maximum doses of FGAs such as
intramuscular (IM) chlorpromazine and IM haloperidol,
and IM fluphenazine deconate depot were 200 mg/day,
20 mg/day, and 50 mg/week, respectively. The maximum
daily doses for SGAs such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and
risperidone were 20 mg, 800 mg, and 16 mg, respectively. For
the purpose of the study, high-dose antipsychotic therapy
was defined as the total daily dose of single agent being more
than the maximum recommended dose, or the dosage where
the sum of the percentages of the maximum doses of two or
more antipsychotics received by the patient was more than
100%.7,11 For example, if the patient was prescribed quetiapine
400 mg, this would equate to 50% of the maximum
recommended dose.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to indicate patients’
characteristics and medication details. Data were
represented as n (%) for categorical variables, and mean

Original Research

(standard deviation [s.d.]) or median (interquartile range
[IQR]) for continuous variables. To test the association
between categorical variables, the Pearson chi-squared
test was used; for the continuous variables, the Mann–
Whitney U test was used. Binary logistic regression using
the enter method was used to identify the predictors of
high-dose antipsychotic therapy. Data were analysed
using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, US) and
a p-value < 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.

Ethical considerations
Ethical clearance to conduct this study was received from the
institutional review boards of both the College of Pharmacy,
Mustansiriyah University, and the Iraqi Ministry of Health
(reference no: 130133). Data were deidentified to protect
patient confidentiality.

Results

Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of
the study population
Of the 225 patients admitted during the study period,
115 (51.1%) were male and 110 (48.9%) were female. The
median age was 30.0 years (range: 18–82), with a mean age of
33.9 (s.d. = 13.46). Most patients (79.1%) had a diagnosis of
schizophrenia or psychosis, 15.6% had a diagnosis of mood
disorders, and 5.3% had substance-related mental disorders.
The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days, with a
range of 1–41 days. Nearly 14% were readmitted during
the study period, and 20.4% left against medical advice
(Table 1).

Prescription pattern of antipsychotics
Just over one half (52.4%, n = 118) of patients received
antipsychotic monotherapy, while 47.6% (n = 107) were
prescribed polypharmacy: 35.6% received two antipsychotics
and 12.0% received three antipsychotics. All patients received
SGAs, while only 23.1% of them also received FGAs. The
most commonly prescribed medication was olanzapine
(73.3%) followed by quetiapine (56.1%) and chlorpromazine
(3.8%), while the least prescribed was fluphenazine depot
injection (2.7%). Procyclidine, an anticholinergic medication,
was given to 37.9%. Other psychotropic medications
prescribed concomitantly included benzodiazepines (80.4%),
mood stabilisers (75.1%), and antidepressants (23.6%).
All patient recipients of antipsychotic monotherapy were
prescribed SGAs. For those receiving antipsychotic
polypharmacy, the most commonly used combination was
two agents from the SGAs, accounting for 43.0%, followed
by one agent from FGAs and another agent from SGAs
(30.8%). Nearly a quarter of patients (25.2%) received two
agents from SGAs and one from the FGAs, and only one
patient (0.9%) received two agents from FGAs and one
from the SGAs. The most commonly used combination
was olanzapine and quetiapine (41.1%), followed by
olanzapine, quetiapine, and chlorpromazine (15.9%), and
olanzapine and haloperidol (8.4%) (see Table 2).

Prevalence and predictors of high-dose
antipsychotics
In this study, 35.6% (n = 80) received high-dose
antipsychotic therapy, which was through antipsychotic
polypharmacy in 93.8% (n = 75) of cases, and only 6.2%

(n = 5) had high-dose as a result of using one medication
exclusively, namely, olanzapine at a dose exceeding the
maximum recommended dose. Nearly half of high-dose
recipients, that is, 53.8% (n = 43), were prescribed doses
between 100% and 150% of the high-dose limit, 45.0%
(n = 36) were between 150% – 200% and 1.3% (n = 1)
received more than 200%. Dosage details of prescribed
antipsychotic medications are displayed in Table 3.
In the bivariate analysis, prescription of high-dose was
not associated with age, sex, hospital stay, or the admission
and discharge status. On the other hand, high-dose
was associated with psychiatric diagnosis, polypharmacy,
FGAs, olanzapine and quetiapine, benzodiazepines,
antidepressants, and procyclidine (see Table 4). According to
the multivariate binary logistic regression, the predictors of
high-dose in the descending order were polypharmacy
(adjusted odd ratio [AOR]: 12.61; 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.78, 89.50), FGAs (AOR: 7.05; 95% CI 1.33, 37.44),
quetiapine (AOR: 5.66; 95% CI 1.16, 27.53), procyclidine
(AOR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.05, 0.55), and antidepressants (AOR:
0.19; 95% CI 0.05, 0.76) (see Table 5).

Discussion
In this study, all patients received SGAs, while 23.1% also
received FGAs. Olanzapine was the most commonly
prescribed antipsychotic medication at a rate of 73.3%
followed by quetiapine at 56.1%. Polypharmacy was
common, with 47.6% of patients receiving more than one
antipsychotic medication: 35.6% received two antipsychotics
and 12.0% received three. High-dose antipsychotics, which
were prescribed to 35.6% of patients, result primarily from
polypharmacy. Notably, 45.0% of high-dose prescriptions
exceeded 150% of the recommended dose limit. Multivariate
regression analysis indicated no association between highdose antipsychotic prescription and demographic or clinical
factors such as age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis, length of
hospital stay, number of admissions, and discharge status.
Predictors of receiving high-dose include antipsychotic
polypharmacy, FGAs, quetiapine, antidepressants, and
anticholinergic prescribing. Our findings are in line with an
Australian study, which found that treatment-related factors
were the primary predictors of high-dose antipsychotic
prescribing.5
In this study, 35.6% received high-dose antipsychotic therapy.
This rate is comparable to the 27.0% rate reported in Australia
and Cyprus, but is lower than the 50.8% rate reported in
Italy.5,6,7 There is no reliable evidence that increasing the dose
beyond the standard dose is associated with better response;

this practice is associated with increased frequency and
severity of side effects, particularly sudden cardiac death.17 For
antipsychotics to be effective, they should achieve 65% – 80%
D2 receptor occupancy in the brain.11 Although there are
reports of altered numbers or function of D2 receptors in a
subgroup of patients, there is little evidence to support this,
because therapeutic response is achieved in low to moderate
doses.11 Schizophrenia and related psychoses are heterogeneous
illnesses with multiple aetiologies, and in some patients,
symptoms may not be dopamine-mediated. Therefore,
increasing the dose of antipsychotics is clearly pointless.11
Furthermore, in a recent randomised study of 54 inpatients
who were receiving high-dose antipsychotics before admission,
lowering the administered antipsychotic dose to half, led to
faster symptom improvement compared to those who stayed
on high doses (1–3 weeks versus 4–9 weeks).18
Polypharmacy was a predictor of receiving high-dose, which
is in line with other studies.8 In this study, only 6.2% received
high-dose through monotherapy. A similar study in Italy
indicates that patients on antipsychotic polypharmacy are 2.75
times more likely to receive high-dose antipsychotics.6 In the
largest UK audit, the Prescribing Observatory for Mental
Health, which analysed prescription patterns of antipsychotics
http://www.sajpsychiatry.org

among 3492 inpatients, found that 25.0% of inpatients were
receiving high-dose antipsychotics, which occurred as a result
of antipsychotic polypharmacy in 86.0% of cases.19 Similar
findings were reported in a Saudi Arabian study.20
In this study, 47.6% of patients received polypharmacy
which is similar to a study in Qatar that included inpatients
and outpatients where 55.9% of patients were on
monotherapy, 29.6% on dual and 14.5% on more than two
agents.21 The antipsychotic polypharmacy rate was also
similar to that reported in the United Kingdom (50.5%),
Australia (43%), Canada (45.0%) and Italy (55.0%), but lower
than 24.0% and 35.0% as reported in Japan and Denmark,
respectively.4,6,10,22,23,24 As the number of prescribed
antipsychotic increases, the life span shortens.9 Thus,
prescribing antipsychotic polypharmacy is not only against
guidelines recommendations but can also risk patient safety;
even in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine
monotherapy is recommended before antipsychotic
polypharmacy.2,3 Evidence for antipsychotic polypharmacy
is only available for clozapine in treatment-resistant
schizophrenia. Clozapine has a weak D2 receptor affinity.
The addition of potent D2 receptor blockers such as sulpride,
amisulpride or aripiprazole, would provide a greater
coverage of receptors for optimised antipsychotic efficacy.25
In addition, aripiprazole decreases the metabolic side effects
of clozapine and thus, improves tolerability.25
Receiving FGAs was a predictor of receiving high-dose
antipsychotics, which is in line with other studies.26 In this
study, SGAs were the most commonly used, which is in line
with a recent scoping review that indicates higher utilisation
of olanzapine and quetiapine (SGAs) and lower prescription

of haloperidol (FGAs).12 Second-generation antipsychotics
are preferred by clinicians as first-line therapy; thus, the
addition of FGAs to suppress residual positive symptoms
may indicate treatment resistance.10 Thus, this may suggest
that these patients may meet the criteria of treatment
resistance and thus are more likely to receive high-dose.
Likewise, SGAs were a predictor of receiving high-dose,
which is in line with other studies.26 Quetiapine may also be
employed as a hypnotic, and it also has antianxiety and
antidepressant properties.27
Patients receiving high doses are less likely to receive
procyclidine. Other studies reported the opposite, with highdose antipsychotics increasing the likelihood of receiving
anticholinergics.8,28 This may be because of our exclusion of
prescribed as-required medications, which are haloperidol
and chlorpromazine (FGAs). By including only regular
medication, which are mostly SGAs, the need for
anticholinergics is greatly reduced in line with other studies.23
Other studies also reported FGA use as a predictor of
anticholinergic prescription.28 The APA advocates short-term
prophylactic use of anticholinergics only in high-risk patients
susceptible to dystonia, such as young males receiving
parenteral highly potent FGA.2
Less antidepressant use was a predictor of high-dose, which
is in line with other studies.29 Patients receiving high-dose
have more severe psychopathology and are likely treatmentresistant; thus, antipsychotics rather than antidepressants
constitute the primary treatment option for this group of
patients.11 In addition, clinicians may be concerned about
increasing the side effect burden and drug interactions
emerging from the addition of antidepressants to high-dose
antipsychotics.
In this study, no patients received clozapine, which aligns
with the findings from a study in Qatar, where only 2.4%
received clozapine.30 Clozapine is indicated in treatmentresistant schizophrenia, which affects 30.0% of patients with
schizophrenia.10 However, this medication has a special
protocol for initiation and titration and is associated with a
list of side effects that require regular monitoring, such as
agranulocytosis.31 Thus, acutely unwell patients may not
consent to blood sampling, and this hinders its widespread
use.32 In those with treatment resistance, only 4.0% trialled
clozapine before using antipsychotic polypharmacy.9 This
implies that polypharmacy is considered early and that
clinicians may delay prescribing clozapine, which contributes
to increased morbidity and mortality.9
This is the first national study to describe the magnitude and
factors associated with high-dose antipsychotic therapy,
providing a baseline for future monitoring of prescribing
trends. The study is considered representative because the
study site is one of two hospitals in Iraq that provide inpatient
psychiatric care. Although the study design is retrospective,
the data were collected by one experienced clinical pharmacist
researcher, thus minimising variation and enhancing the
data quality. However, because of the cross-sectional nature,

causality cannot be established. In addition, we excluded asrequired antipsychotic medications; thus, the rate of
antipsychotic polypharmacy and high-dose antipsychotics
may be underestimated.
We observed a high rate of antipsychotic polypharmacy and
high-dose antipsychotics, which are unaligned with standard
practice guidelines, increase side effects and drug interactions,
and thus risk patient safety.2,3 Although antipsychotic
polypharmacy may be required initially during acute
hospitalisation, reverting to monotherapy is recommended
long-term to sustain response.12 Recent evidence suggests
that antipsychotic polypharmacy prescribing at discharge
increases the risk of psychiatric readmission.33 Thus, the goal
is to review treatment at discharge to ensure optimal
evidence-based prescribing.
It is possible that clinicians were unaware that they
were pursuing high-dose therapy because, in most cases,
high-dose antipsychotics result from polypharmacy.
Education programmes for clinicians are vital to enhance
adherence to guidelines and ensure optimal delivery of
psychopharmacological therapy. Clozapine and long-acting
injectable antipsychotics are effective in reducing the risk of
relapse, and thus, improving the utilisation of these agents as
maintenance therapy, when appropriate, especially in those
with multiple admissions, should be considered.2,11
Information regarding the adverse effects of antipsychotics
or previous clozapine trial for those receiving antipsychotic
polypharmacy is lacking in the medical records. Reasons for
prescribing antipsychotic polypharmacy should be clearly
documented in the medical records. Furthermore, the
inclusion of pharmacists specialised in mental health as a
part of a multidisciplinary team is important to enhance
guideline adherence and promote optimal use of
antipsychotics. Finally, a qualitative survey to assess the
psychiatrists’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards
the prescription of combined and high-dose antipsychotics is
warranted.

Conclusion
The study’s findings indicate that one in three patients
received high-dose antipsychotics. Patients receiving
combined antipsychotics or FGAs are particularly at risk.
This practice, which is not endorsed by guidelines, should be
reviewed to ensure patient safety. Targeted educational
interventions are recommended to enhance adherence to
prescription guidelines and optimise treatment outcomes.
