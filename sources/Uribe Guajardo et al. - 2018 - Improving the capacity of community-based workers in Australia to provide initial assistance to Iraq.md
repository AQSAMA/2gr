Abstract
Background: Australia is a multicultural nation with a humanitarian program that welcomes a large number of Iraqi
refugees. Despite the high prevalence of trauma related disorders, professional help-seeking in this group is very
low. This study sought to evaluate a face-to-face mental health literacy (MHL) Course that teaches community-based
workers how to provide initial help to Iraqi refugees with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related
problems.
Methods: An uncontrolled pre, post and follow-up design was used to measure improvement in MHL in commu‑
nity-based workers assisting Iraqi refugees.
Results: Eighty-six participants completed the pre- and post-training questionnaires. Forty-five (52%) completed
all 3-time point questionnaires. Fifty-six percent (48/86) of participants were able to correctly recognise ‘PTSD’ as
the problem depicted in a vignette before the training. This increased to 77% (66/86) after training and was main‑
tained at follow-up with 82% (37/45) correctly recognising the problem (p = 0.032). Recognition of depression also
increased from 69% (59/86) at pre-training to 83% (71/86) after training and to 82% (37/45) at follow-up. There was
a significant increase in perceived helpfulness of professional treatments for depression after training (p < 0.001 at
post-training, p = 0.010 at follow-up). Significant changes were reported in confidence of participants when helping
an Iraqi refugee with PSTD (p < 0.001 at post-training, p < 0.001 at follow-up) and depression (p < 0.001 at post-training,
p = 0.003 at follow-up). A decrease were also found on social distance mean scores associated with PTSD (p = 0.006
at post-training, p < 0.001 at follow-up) and depression (p = 0.007 at follow-up). Changes were not significant following
training for offering help and helping behaviours in both PSTD and depression vignettes and, the ‘dangerous/unpre‑
dictable’ subscale in the depression vignette.
Conclusion: This training is a recommendable way to improve and better equip staff on how to respond to mental
health crises and offer Mental Health First Aid in a culturally sensitive manner to Iraqi refugees.

Background
Australian refugee resettlement

Australia is a multicultural nation with a humanitarian
program that seeks to welcome refugees fleeing violence
and oppression in their country of origin [1]. One of the
top source countries for refugee application to Australia
is Iraq [2] with almost 14,000 Iraqi refugees resettled in
Australia in the period 2010–2015 alone [3]. Recently,
Australia committed to resettle additional places for refugees from Iraq and Syria in response to the sectarian violence from extremist groups in the Middle East [4].
Under the Australian Humanitarian Programme, there
are services that provide both immediate and ongoing
assistance designed to facilitate the long-term settlement of new arrivals into Australian society [5]. These
programs include assistance in finding employment,
accommodation, improving English skills, and providing health care, all with the common goal of building
individuals’ self-reliance and fostering connections with
mainstream services [5]. In Australia, state government
health organisations are responsible for the assessment
of refugee health status in the areas of immunisation,
oral health, infectious diseases, reproductive health and
mental health, amongst others [6]. Additionally, resettlement social services are commonly offered by non-government organisations. In New South Wales (NSW), and
specifically in the South Western Sydney area, there are
several organisations, such as migrant resources centres,
ethnic community-based organisations and English colleges, which are responsible for helping refugees to settle
[7]. The concentration of such organisations in the South
Western Sydney area reflects the high density of resettled refugees residing locally, being one of the most culturally-diverse districts nationwide [8]. In terms of those
who provide these social services, their training is often
diverse (English tutors, community case workers) [7], but
most often lacks a component of mental health training.
Given that these workers are often the first point of contact and play an important role in assisting resettling refugees to help navigate the Australian system [7], having
basic mental health skills would be valuable.
Refugee mental health

It is well known that refugees are at high risk of poor
mental health outcomes due to pre-displacement events
such as high level of trauma exposure, violence and deprivation suffered in their country of origin along with the
challenges faced during and after the resettlement period
[9, 10]. The literature highlights the particular nature of
the refugee context as significant determinants of poor
mental health for refugees. This in turn leads to issues of
greater complexity of care and reduced health outcomes
[11, 12], and Iraqi refugees are not an exemption [13].

Page 2 of 13

An Australian-based study [14] conducted with resettled Iraqi refugees that aimed to explore psychological
status and mental health literacy reported that over 30%
of participants met the threshold for clinically significant
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology
and almost 40% of them experienced severe psychological distress which greatly exceeds rates reported for the
Australian general population [15].
Help‑seeking in refugees: cross‑cultural factors

Despite the greater need for specialised mental health
care, help-seeking amongst Iraqi refugees is reportedly
low. In an Australian-based study conducted to explore
help-seeking and psychological trauma in Iraqi refugees,
it was reported that only 19% of the sample sought any
kind of help (professional and non-professional) and of
those, less than 45% reported seeking professional help
from a general practitioner, psychiatrist or psychologist
with the majority reporting help-seeking from a family
member [16].
There are, of course, multiple factors impacting on professional help-seeking by refugees with mental health
problems. One of the most significant barriers to professional help-seeking not only for Iraqi refugees but also
for the general public, is the stigma attached to mental
health problems [17, 18]. Perceived and personal stigma,
discrimination and social distance towards people with
mental health problems are often reported and have been
well researched for some decades now [17, 18]. Within
the Iraqi community, it is common for men not to seek
help for fear of appearing weak when they are expected to
be strong and support their families [19]. This is strongly
linked with the discrimination that many refugees face if
someone from their community knows about their mental health problems [19, 20].
Other barriers to professional help-seeking can include
unaffordable transportation and low English proficiency
[21]. More broadly, there is a lack of experience and understanding on how to navigate the Western healthcare system [22]. It has been proposed that refugees might tend to
seek informal help due to the lack of formal mental health
assistance available for the public in their country of origin
[22]. In addition, It has been reported that less acculturated refugees would be less likely to discuss their problems
and less likely to believe in usefulness of professional help
than those who were more acculturated [23].
A way forward: improving mental health literacy
of resettlement workers

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO),
in an optimal mental health service framework the role
of informal service provision is essential, with a recommendation to upskill local community members such as

Uribe Guajardo et al. Int J Ment Health Syst (2018) 12:2

lay volunteers, community workers, humanitarian aid
workers, and other professionals such as teachers and
police officials [24]. Functions performed by these informal service providers can include assistance with activities of daily living and reintegration into the community,
prevention and promotion services, practical support, crisis support and identification of mental health problems,
and referral to health services. Some of the WHO initiatives that have been developed in partnership with other
organisations included training Kwazakhele volunteers
and community members to improve their mental health
literacy, improving support of and outreach to individuals
who have dropped out from formal services in the in the
Eastern Cape Province of South Africa [24].
Given the lack of mental health training in many people
who assist refugees, and the high prevalence of mental
disorders reported in refugees who are unlikely to seek
professional help, the current study aimed to provide initial training to staff working in resettlement organisations
and community-based settings. Specifically, this study
sought to improve metal health literacy levels by delivering a Mental Health Literacy Course to those who work
in the resettlement of refugees, with the aim to better
equip these workers to respond to mental health crises
and offer first aid to this group. The term ‘mental health
literacy’ refers to, ‘knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management
or prevention’ [25]. This encompasses (a) the public’s
knowledge of how to prevent mental disorders, (b) recognition of when a disorder is developing, (c) knowledge of
help-seeking options and treatments available, (d) knowledge of effective self-help strategies for milder problems,
and (e) first aid skills to support others affected by mental
health problems [25]. Increasing mental health literacy
can achieve an important goal of empowering the public with an understanding of mental disorders, thereby
facilitating prevention, early intervention and treatment
within the community [26].
Mental Health First Aid is ‘the help offered to a person developing a mental health problem, experiencing
a worsening of an existing mental health problem or in
a mental health crisis. The first aid is given until appropriate professional help is received or until the crisis
resolves’ (p. 12) [27]. A Mental Health First Aid (MHFA)
training program was developed in Australia in 2000 with
the goal of improving recognition of mental disorders,
reducing stigma and promoting appropriate help-seeking, self-care and support from others in the community
[28]. The Standard MHFA course is delivered in a 12-h
workshop and teaches the application of a Mental Health
First Aid Action Plan to offer initial assistance to a person
with a mental health problem or in a mental health crises
[27] (Fig. 1).

Page 3 of 13

Fig. 1 Mental Health First Aid Action Plan. MHFA Action Plan for
providing Mental Health First Aid. Like the successful D.R.A.B.C Action
Plan for emergency medical first aid, the MHFA Training and Research
program uses the ALGEE Action Plan, to teach members of the public
how to assist individuals with mental health problems to manage
symptoms and seek appropriate help

It has since been evaluated in multiple studies in Australia and other countries, demonstrating its acceptability and effectiveness [29]. Remarkably, since 2001, the
MHFA training program has been disseminated rapidly
and gained recognition, with many countries licensing
the MHFA course and adapting it to their specific cultural environment [28].
To increase the evidence base of the MHFA program, a
series of Delphi studies have been conducted to develop
expert consensus guidelines on what constitutes appropriate Mental Health First Aid for a range of mental
health problems or crises [28], and to develop additional
guidelines on provision of culturally-specific Mental Health First Aid for minorities in Australia [30, 31].
Recently, a consensus study was carried out to develop
guidelines on important additional considerations when
providing Mental Health First Aid to Iraqi refugees [32].
This evidence informed an adapted short 7-h Mental
Health Literacy Course in how to assist Iraqi refugees
with depression and PTSD problems or crises. This 7-h
Mental Health Literacy Course was based on part of the
MHFA training curriculum, with permission from Mental Health First Aid Australia. In the present study, this
novel adapted training course was delivered to community-based workers and examined whether the training was effective in changing participants’ knowledge,
increasing the quality of helping intentions and increasing positive behaviours and attitudes towards Iraqi
refugees with depression and PTSD problems. It was
hypothesized that the 1-day training intervention would
be associated with an increase in participants’ knowledge
about mental health problems, in the quality of helping
intentions and behaviours and a decrease in participants’
negative attitudes towards Iraqi refugees with mental
health problems.

Methods
Participants

Based on a power analysis, a desired sample size of n = 57
was required. This assumed that the training intervention
would have a medium effect and made the conservative
assumption that there was no correlation between preand post-training scores. With these assumptions this
number would give 95% power to detect a medium effect
size (d = 0.5) from pre- to post-training and follow-up
with an alpha of 0.05.
A total of 86 participants were trained and responded
the pre- and post-training questionnaires, with 45 (52%)
completing the 6-month follow-up questionnaire.
Participants were community-based workers, based in
Western Sydney, assisting Iraqi refugees on their resettlement. The training was advertised in major refugee
health networks, by sending a flyer in an email format
and a newsletter to several agencies that provide aid to
humanitarian entrants.
Participants were volunteers who made contact with
the principal investigator (MGU) for enrolment and
other information. Workers were eligible to participate if
they were working with refugee clients on a permanent
basis and had no prior mental health training. Potential
participants were excluded if they had university training
(or degree) in mental health or had experience working
in refugee mental health.
These workers were targeted for convenience sampling
because they provide assistance to a group at very high
risk of developing mental health problems [14]. Approval
for this research was granted by the Western Sydney University Human Research Ethics Committee, reference
number H11420.
Intervention

The training intervention was a 7-h, classroom-style
education program. It included didactic teaching using
a PowerPoint presentation, films demonstrating how
to provide assistance, small-group learning activities
and whole-group discussion components. A teaching
manual was developed to guide facilitation and ensure
fidelity. Training was delivered by one primary instructor and principal investigator (MGU). The instructor
undertook the standard Mental Health First Aid course
in combination with one-on-one instructor session with
MHFA Australia Founder Ms Betty Kitchener. The program content was presented across 2 sessions, morning
and afternoon with two 15-min breaks and one longer
lunchbreak. The units taught are presented in Table 1.
The structure and content were developed based on the
successful model devised by the MHFA program [27].
The information presented on symptoms, risk factors,
warning signs, effective evidence-based treatments and

Page 4 of 13

early intervention was gleaned from reviews of current
scientific literature [27]. The information provided on
Mental Health First Aid strategies was based on existing MHFA guidelines for depression and traumatic
events [33, 34]. In addition, the workshop included content based on the guidelines on important considerations when providing Mental Health First Aid to Iraqi
refugees with depression and PTSD problems (details in
Table 1) [32].
All participants were given a copy of the standard
MHFA manual (3rd edition) [27] along with the booklet on important considerations when providing Mental
Health First Aid to Iraqi Refugees [35].
To aid in the learning experience in the training session, the authors developed a culturally-sensitive video
of a scripted drama depicting a male Iraqi refugee with
mental health problems and a male teacher from an
Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) applying the
Mental Health First Aid Action Plan.

Measures

An assessment battery, including a range of self-report
questionnaires (Additional file 1), was designed to measure change in knowledge, attitudes and the quality of
helping intentions and behaviours in participants when
providing first aid to Iraqi refugees. Information on the
demographic characteristics of participants was also collected. Table 2 shows the variables measured across time
points.
Recognition and knowledge of mental health problems

Recognition of mental health problems and knowledge
of treatments was assessed using a culturally-valid mental health literacy survey developed by Slewa-Younan and
collaborators [14]. The survey contained two vignettes.
The first vignette described a fictional male Iraqi refugee, ‘Dawood’, who had been exposed to trauma prior to
leaving Iraq and who was suffering symptoms of PTSD,
according to criteria outlined in 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM
5) [36] (Additional file 2). The second vignette described
a fictional female Iraqi refugee ‘Miriam’ who had been
exposed to trauma prior to leaving Iraq and who was
suffering symptoms of depression, according to criteria
outlined in DSM 5 [36] (Additional file 2). Following the
presentation of the vignettes, participants were asked in
an open-ended format: `What, if anything, do you think
is wrong with ‘Dawood/Miriam’?. The use of vignettes
in mental health literacy research and mental health
research more broadly, has been demonstrated to be ecologically valid [37, 38].
Coding for recognition of PTSD and depression was
based on responses using key words. The labels were
included in the ‘PTSD label category’ if they were very
similar (or the same) to the correct label and contained

Page 5 of 13

any of the following wording: ‘PTSD’; ‘post-traumatic
stress disorder’; ‘post-trauma/tic stress/disorder’ and
‘PTS’.
In the case of recognition of depression, labels included
in this category were ‘depression’; ‘depressed’ and ‘depressive’. In terms of the ‘general mental health problem’ category, labels that qualify to be included were ‘mental
problem’, ‘mental illness’ and ‘mental disorder’.
Participants’ beliefs about helpfulness of various
interventions for the problems described in vignettes
were also assessed. Specifically, participants were asked
whether each of a number of interventions would be
‘Helpful’. For the analysis purposes, researchers treated
helpfulness of interventions for PTSD and depression as
continuous data. This procedure involved selecting interventions highly endorsed by health professionals (e.g.
consulting a general practitioner or psychiatrist, undergoing treatment activities such as CBT or psychotherapy,
and antidepressants) [39, 40]. Participants were awarded
a point for each professional intervention they endorsed
that was known to be effective as previously noted [39].
Knowledge of mental disorders was measured by a
15-item questionnaire specifically designed to cover
information in the course. This was a modified version
of a questionnaire previously utilised in MHFA evaluation trials [41]. The questionnaire included a mixture of
statements reflecting both general knowledge of mental
health problems in addition to culturally sensitive items
required when assisting Iraqi refugees with mental health
problems. Some examples of these items were ‘Non-Western cultures tend to classify their distress using somatic or
vegetative complaints such as headaches, disturbances of
sleep or lack of energy’; ‘Antidepressant medications can
be an effective treatment for most anxiety disorders’ and
‘PTSD and depressive disorders are the most prevalent

mental illness in the Iraqi population’. Response options
for each item were ‘Agree’, ‘Disagree’ or ‘Don’t know’.
Scoring was based on 1 point per correct response, providing a maximum score of 15.
Attitudes
Social distance scale

Attitudes towards an Iraqi refugee with PTSD and
depression were measured using a social distance scale
developed by Link and colleagues [42]. Participants
were asked the following items: ‘How you would feel
about spending time with Dawood/Miriam?’; ‘Would
you be happy: To move next door to Dawood/Miriam?;
To spend some time socializing with Dawood/Miriam?;
To make friends with Dawood/Miriam?; To work closely
with Dawood/Miriam on a project at work?; and; To have
Dawood/Miriam marry into your family?’. Items were
rated on a 4-point Likert scale composed of ‘1 = Yes,
definitely’, ‘2 = Yes, probably’, ‘3 = Probably not’, and
‘4 = Definitely not’ as response options. In a large nationally representative sample of Australian adults, Yap et al.
[37] found that social distance constituted a distinct factor of stigma that can be measured reliably (Cronbach’s
alpha = 0.88). In the current study, the alphas were
0.91 and 0.92 for the PTSD and depression vignettes,
respectively.
Personal stigma: weak‑not‑sick and dangerous/
unpredictable subscales

The second measure used to assess negative attitudes of
participants was the personal stigma in response to mental illness scale first devised by Griffiths and colleagues
[43], and revised by Yap and colleagues [37]. This modified scale comprises two subscales. The first component
is composed by 4 items which was labelled ‘weak-notsick’ comprising personal stigma items about beliefs
that the person was weak, not ill, could control their
behaviour, and should be avoided. Some examples of this
subcategory were ‘Dawood/Miriam could snap out of it
if they wanted’ or ‘Dawood’s/Miriam’s problem is a sign
of personal weakness’. A second component was named
‘Dangerous/unpredictable’ which is comprised by 5 items
about dangerousness or unpredictability. Examples of the
items of this category were ‘Dawood/Miriam is dangerous’ or Miriam’s problem makes her unpredictable’. Ratings for each item were made on a 5-point Likert scale
in both subscales (‘1 = Strongly disagree’, ‘2 = Disagree’,
‘3 = Neither agree nor disagree’, ‘4 = Agree’, ‘5 = Strongly
agree’). In this paper, the categories ‘Agree’ and ‘Strongly
agree’ were combined and summed separately for each
subscale.
The validity of these scales is shown by a factor analysis of personal stigma items from a large nationally

Page 6 of 13

representative sample of Australian adults, which found
separate ‘weak-not-sick’ and ‘dangerous-unpredictable’
factors [37]. The scales were found to have reliabilities (Cronbach’s alpha) of 0.74 and 0.55 respectively. In
the current study, the alphas for ‘weak-not-sick’ subscale were 0.77 and 0.73 for the PTSD and depression
vignettes, respectively. Alphas for the ‘dangerous-unpredictable’ subscale were 0.62 and 0.75 for the PTSD and
depression vignette, respectively.
Higher scores denoted higher levels of negative attitudes (social distance; weak-not-sick and Dangerous/
unpredictable beliefs).
Intention to help

Intention to help an Iraqi refugee with mental health
problems was measured using 2 questions devised in
a previous MHFA evaluation study [41] administered
at pre, post and follow-up time points. Firstly, participants were asked ‘If Dawood/Miriam was one of your
students or clients, I would help him/her’. Rating for this
item was made on a 7-point Likert scale (‘1 = Strongly
disagree’, ‘2 = Mostly disagree’, ‘3 = Somewhat disagree’,
‘4 = Neither agree nor disagree’, ‘5 = Somewhat agree’,’
6 = Mostly agree’, ‘7 = Strongly agree’).
Secondly, participants were asked to ‘Describe all the
things you would do to help Dawood/Miriam’. De-identified and randomly intermixed responses were scored by
an associated researcher (YM) who was blind to whether
they were collected at pre-, post- or 6-month follow-up.
A quality scoring system was utilised to measure the
quality of these helping intentions devised by Yap and
Jorm, [44]. This scoring system is based on the MHFA
Action Plan taught in the third edition of the MHFA
course [27]. Responses are awarded a point for each component of the Action Plan they mention (i.e. Approach
the person, Assess and Assist with any crisis, Listen nonjudgmentally, Give support and information, Encourage
appropriate professional help and Encourage other supports) and an additional point per category where specific details are given (e.g. ‘Encourage the person to see
a psychologist’ would receive two points for Encourage
appropriate professional help). Responses can receive a
minimum of 0 and a maximum of 2 points per component, giving a total score representing the quality of the
response that ranges from 0 to 12. This score has previously been found to predict quality of subsequent helping
behaviours, indicating its validity [45].
Confidence helping

To assess confidence, participants were asked ‘How confident do you feel in helping someone with a problem like
Dawood/Miriam?’ extracted from a previous MHFA
evaluation study [41]. Responses were rated on a 5-point

Uribe Guajardo et al. Int J Ment Health Syst (2018) 12:2

Likert scale from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Extremely’. Confidence
has been previously found to predict quality of subsequent helping behaviours [45], indicating the validity of
such ratings.
Helping behaviours

In order to assess actual helping behaviours, participants
were asked ‘over the last 6 months, has anyone that you
have assisted (Iraqi refugee) had any sort of mental health
problem?’ and ‘did you try to help the person with this
problem?’ at pre-training and 6-month follow-up‘.
Participants were also asked to describe all the things
they did to help the person (Iraqi refugee) retrospectively
at pre-training and 6-month follow-up. Again, open
ended responses rating were performed by an associated
researcher (YM) based on the scoring system devised in a
previous study [44].
Higher scores on these attitude measures denoted better quality of helping intentions and behaviours and,
increased confidence when offering help.
Design and analyses

The effectiveness of the training program was evaluated
using an uncontrolled, repeated measures pre, post and
six-month follow-up design.
Continuous variables are presented as means, whereas
categorical variables are expressed as percentage (%) frequencies for pre-, post-training and follow-up points.
All 86 participants completed the pre- and post-training
questionnaire, however only 45 participants completed
the 6-month follow-up questionnaire. All missing data
were multiply imputed using multivariate normal imputation method assuming arbitrary missingness, as the
missing value pattern showed a mixture of monotonic
and non-monotonic missingness. The number of imputations performed was 10. Mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models were used to analyse continuous or
binary outcome variables as appropriate.
The results for mixed effects regression based on multiply imputed datasets were finally pooled using Rubin’s
method [46].
Finally, a paired sample t test was used to assess
changes on actual helping behaviours, which was administered at two time points, pre-training and 6 months
after the training completion.
An alpha level of 0.05 for all statistical tests was used.
All analyses were performed using SAS (9.4) [47].

Results
Training workshops were held between April and June
2016. Figure 2 displays participant flow through the
research stages. Demographic data of the participants are
presented in Table 3.

Recognition and knowledge of PTSD and depression

Table 4 presents data on participants’ recognition and
knowledge of and attitudes towards PTSD and depression across pre-, post-training and 6-month follow-up.
In response to the question ‘What, if anything, do you
think is wrong with ‘Dawood’?, 56% of participants correctly recognised the problem as ‘PTSD’ before training and 77% of them did after training (p = 0.001). This
improved recognition of PTSD was retained at follow-up,
with 82% of participants correctly noting the disorder in
the vignette (p = 0.032).
To assess whether recognition of the problem in the
PTSD vignette as just a ‘general mental health problem’
improved over time, the frequencies of all other responses
representing a mental health related label (‘mental illness’,
‘mental problem’, ‘mental breakdown’, ‘mental issue’) were
included. There was an increase of problem recognition
from pre- to post-training (p < 0.001), with percentages
increasing from 71 to 96.5%, and remaining high at follow-up, with 98% of participants recognising the problem
in the vignette as a mental health problem.
In response to the depression vignette, 69% of participants were able to correctly identify Miriam’s problem as
‘depression’ at pre-training. Immediately following training, this increased to 83.5% at post-training and then to
82.2% at follow-up. However, these gains between pre- to
post-training and follow-up rates were not significant.
When analysing the number of participants recognising the problem described in the depression vignette as
a ‘general mental health problem’, there was a significant
increase from 77.9% at pre-training to 97.7% at posttraining (p = 0.004). Recognition remained very high at
follow-up, with 95.6% participant noting the vignette as a
general mental health problem (p = 0.921).
A significant improvement in participants’ knowledge
about mental health problems and Mental Health First
Aid knowledge was noted from pre- to post-training
(p < 0.001). However, there was a significant reduction of
knowledge at 6-month follow-up (p < 0.001).
Beliefs of helpfulness of treatments for PTSD
and depression

Following training, participants were more likely to
endorse professional recognised treatment for PTSD
(p < 0.001). However, these gains were not maintained at
follow-up. In addition, a significant increase was noted for

at follow-up compared with pre-training, however the
difference was not significant.
Participants’ social distance scale scores decreased substantially (p = 0.006) after training with regards to PTSD
vignette. A significant decrease in social distance towards
PTSD from pre-training to follow-up was also found
(p < 0.001).
When considering the depression vignette, the personal stigma subscale of ‘weak-not-sick’ decreased after

training (p = 0.013) and remained lower at follow-up,
although this decrease was not significant.
In terms of social distance towards depression, participants’ scores decreased significantly from pre-training to
follow-up (p = .007).
Confidence in providing help

Confidence helping the person in the PTSD vignette
(p < 0.001 at post-training, p < 0.001 at follow-up)

depression vignette (p < 0.001 at post training, p = 0.003
at follow-up).
Intention to provide help

Helping intentions scores for the PTSD and depression
vignettes were only significantly different between pretraining and post-training (p < 0.001). Greater quality of
helping intentions regarding the depression vignette were
also reported at post-training (p < 0.001).
Helping behaviours

A total of 16 participants provided responses to indicate
that they had in fact actually tried to help someone and
described in detail these interventions that allowed for
measure of helping behaviours to be scored, with a comparison undertaken between pre-training and follow-up
time points. Although not statistically significant, there
was a slight increase in scores between the two time
points.

Discussion
The current study sought to evaluate whether the tailored Mental Health Literacy Course on providing help
to Iraqi refugees with mental health problems was effective in changing participants’ knowledge, intentions,
confidence and attitudes. Post intervention, our results
demonstrated a significant impact on most of the mental
health literacy measures, namely improving recognition
of PTSD and depression, increasing knowledge of mental health problems and evidence-based interventions,
improving participants’ intention to help and decreasing
negative attitudes. Of note was the significant improvement in participant’s confidence in helping an Iraqi refugee, which was found at both post intervention and at
6 month follow-up.
Recognising when an Iraqi client has symptoms of
PTSD or depression is an important skill to have when
workers are tasked with providing services to assist in
their resettlement, such as English tuition. Our training
provided a learning platform that assisted participants
through the provision of culturally-appropriate resources
developed to improve understanding around the Iraqi
culture (e.g. Iraqi patriarchal society, males rarely speaking out, and communication barriers) [32]. This may have
contributed to the high proportion of participants accurately identifying the problem presented in the vignette
even at 6 months following training. Further, this adapted
Mental Health Literacy Course included best practice
guidelines on how to help Iraqi refugees with mental
health problems, and a culturally specific film that provided strategies on how to provide initial help to an Iraqi
refugee with PTSD-related problems, which again may

Page 10 of 13

have contributed to the significant improvement in most
mental health literacy measures.
Previous Australian based research has demonstrated
the existence of dual preferences for treatments amongst
resettled Iraqi refugees, such as seeking help from a psychiatrist in addition to reading religious texts [14]. This
information was discussed in this tailored program in
order to provide participants with a clearer cultural
understanding. However, in order to prepare the first
aider so that they can encourage a person to get appropriate professional help and other supports, information
on evidence based interventions (psychological, medical and self-help strategies) were provided as part of the
training program [48, 49]. Our training was effective in
increasing knowledge on evidence-based interventions,
such as consulting a general practitioner or psychiatrist,
undergoing treatment activities such as CBT or psychotherapy, and antidepressants.
Additionally, other positive and significant impacts of
this training were found on levels of confidence in helping an Iraqi refugee with PTSD and depression-related
problems. Confidence levels increased markedly after
training and were maintained at follow-up. We believe
this could be associated with the ability to recognise the
problem as ‘PTSD’ or ‘depression’ in a cross-cultural setting, as well as the increased level of knowledge about
professionally-aligned helpful interventions for managing these conditions. Further, a significant change was
noted in social distance scores regarding PTSD, which
reduced over time. It could be argued that this change in
the attitudes of participants towards someone experiencing PTSD-related problems can be linked again, to their
improved capacity to recognise the problem as a genuine
health problem.
However, not all the mental health literacy components
demonstrated improvement. It is difficult to postulate
the reasons for this and in future incorporating qualitative interviews of participants may assist in teasing out
such findings. It is important to note that this was a pilot
project to assess the usefulness of training informed by
the guidelines on important considerations when providing Mental Health First Aid to Iraqi refugees in Australia.
However, for broader dissemination this short 7-h training course may be best integrated into the Standard 12-h
MHFA course, which has been widely disseminated in
Australia and in over 20 other countries.
Several limitations of this study must be noted. This
study utilised an uncontrolled design with a small sample
size. As the current study formed part of a PhD project,
limited funding and timeframe required a more pragmatic approach to be adopted. An intervention with a
randomised control group design using a larger sample

Uribe Guajardo et al. Int J Ment Health Syst (2018) 12:2

size would be ideal. In addition, this study used a convenience sample of volunteers and thus unlikely to be
representative to all community-based workers. Other
methodological limitations include the self-reported
nature of the assessments and that the scoring of helping
intentions was undertaken by only one blinded judge preventing an assessment of inter-rater reliability.
Further, there was no evaluation as to the impact of the
training of these workers on the actual mental health or
help-seeking of their Iraqi refugee clients. In addition,
there was a large dropout rate of participants at followup, although it was dealt with using multiple imputation.
Future studies should use more assertive follow-up in
order to reduce the drop-out rate. Other future directions should consider efforts directed at improving the
mental health literacy of the Iraqi refugees themselves,
as such programs would complement the current study
as part of a series of efforts to improve the mental health
outcomes of resettling refugees.
Strengths of this study include being the first program
of its kind that seeks to train community-based workers
on how to provide culturally-appropriate initial help to
individuals from an Iraqi refugee background with mental health problems. While there has been an increased
emphasis on cultural competency in mental health care
and the delivery of evidence-based psychosocial services
for ethnic groups [23, 50], to date, culturally-appropriate
psychoeducation initiatives at a community based level
are rare. Secondly, by utilising content from the highlysuccessful standard MHFA training curriculum and
supplementing it with culturally-appropriate guidelines
developed through an expert panel Delphi study [32],
a culturally-salient training program with appropriate
teaching resources was developed. Finally, the processes
and mechanism utilised in this study can potentially
serve as a framework on how to develop culturallyappropriate psychoeducation to workers assisting Iraqi
or other refugee and culturally-and-linguistically-diverse
groups in Australia. Further, with appropriate modifications to the resource booklet [35] accompanying this
training, this could be used in other developed English
speaking countries. However, the effects of the training in
other countries would need evaluation.

Conclusion
This research demonstrates that the tailored program was
effective in improving recognition of PTSD and depression, reducing negative attitudes towards PTSD and
depression problems, changing beliefs regarding treatment to align with those of mental health professionals,
and improving confidence when helping an Iraqi refugee
with PSTD and depression problems. To the best of our

Page 11 of 13

knowledge, this is the first time that a psychoeducation
program has been adapted for workers to assist a refugee
group. It is a recommendable way to improve and better
equip staff on how to respond to mental health crises and
offer Mental Health First Aid in a culturally-aware way
to Iraqi refugees and is a necessary part of the ongoing
efforts needed to improve the resettlement outcomes of
refugees.
