Abstract: Medication adherence, especially among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders, is often seen as a major treatment challenge. The purpose of this study is to systematically
review studies addressing specific aspects of parental factors that are positively or negatively associated with medication adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A
systematic literature search of English language publications, from inception through December 2021,
was conducted from PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE databases. This review has complied with
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines. A total of
23 studies (77,188 participants) met inclusion criteria. Nonadherence rates ranged between 8% to 69%.
Parents’ socioeconomic background, family living status and functioning, parents’ perception and
attitude towards the importance of medication taking in treating psychiatric disorders, and parents’
mental health status are significant parental characteristics associated with medication adherence in
children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. In conclusion, by identifying specific parental
characteristics related to the medication adherence of children and adolescents with psychiatric
disorders, targeted interventions on parents could be developed to guide parents in improving their
child’s medication adherence.

1. Introduction
Mental disorders in children and adolescents are common and possess a significant
impact on their well-being in the long-run [1]. There are a number of reviews that have
reported the significant increase in prevalence of mental disorders among children and

adolescents, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak [2–4]. Globally, an estimated
13% of adolescents aged 10–19 years old [5] experienced mental disorders that are often
times unrecognized and untreated [6,7]. Some of the most commonly diagnosed mental
disorders among children and adolescents are Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD), behavioral problems, depression, and anxiety [1,7]. Since there are no definitions
that established the exact boundaries of the psychiatric disorder concept, hence, as stated
in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision
(DSM-5-TR), mental disorders, also known as psychiatric disorders, may be conceptualized
as a “clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern, associated with present
distress or disability, and is not merely an expected response to common stressors and losses or a
culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, instead was primarily a result of social deviance
or conflicts with society, that occurs in an individual” [8] (p. 5). According to the WHO [7],
failure to address and deal with adolescents onset mental health conditions may lead to
suicide, which is one of the most devastating causes of death, especially among 15- to
19-year-olds. Adolescence is a transitional phase to adulthood that is marked by various
biological, cognitive, and psychosocial changes [9]. Hence, it is a crucial period for family,
educators, and the community, through various mental health interventions, to promote
mental health among adolescents. However, one of the major challenges often faced by
psychiatrists in promoting mental well-being and preventing mental health deterioration,
especially among children and adolescents diagnosed with mental disorders, is medical
adherence towards prescribed treatments and medication [10,11].
According to the WHO [12], medical adherence can be defined as the extent of an
individual’s efforts or behavior in observing treatment-related instructions such as taking medication, following a recommended diet, modifying habits, attending treatment
appointments, abiding to medication prescription, and corresponding with agreed recommendations from a healthcare professional. Non-adherence is seen as one of the major
obstacles and common causes to the increase of mental illness relapses, hospitalization
rates, morbidity, and other harmful outcomes [10,11,13–16]. In reviews conducted among
adolescents with psychiatric disorders who were prescribed psychotropic medications
or received treatment from psychiatric services, 28% to 75% prematurely dropped out of
treatment, a median of 33% adolescents were medically non-adherent, 44% reported no
reliable change, 6% reported reliable deterioration, and 13.2% were often re-hospitalized
due to suicidal attempts made after discharge within a year [15,17–19]. There were not
many studies conducted on medical adherence among children, ages 3 to 12 years old, with
psychiatric disorder. Findings from Edgcomb et al. [19] suggest that in comparison with
adolescents, children tend to have a higher likelihood of reporting adherence to medication.
However, according to Edgcomb et al. [19], review on children and adolescents with psychiatric disorder, medical nonadherence is a widespread problem and should be provided
with equal importance as children and adolescents with other chronic medical illnesses.
There are many determinants of medication adherence that were reported and categorized in various ways [11,14,16,20–22]. The WHO [12] suggested five main categories that covers the multidimensional phenomenon of adherence, which are: (1) socioeconomic factors (low socioeconomic status, illiteracy, lack of family support); (2) providerpatient/health care system factors (poor medication distribution, therapeutic relationship);
(3) therapy-related factors (complexity of medical regimens, duration of treatments or the
immediacy of beneficial effects); (4) condition-related factors (severity of symptoms, rates
of progression or level of disability); and (5) patient-related factors (knowledge and beliefs,
self-determination). Clinical outcomes pertaining to adherence may be common across all
branches of medicine; however, non-adherence among psychiatric patients, in comparison
with patients receiving medication or treatment for physical conditions, poses additional
challenges, such as having to deal with suicidal ideation and emotional outbursts, relapses
as well as stigmatizing attitudes from the patient and the public, that increases the risks of
morbidity [13].

Medication adherence, defined as the degree to which patients’ medication-taking
behavior corresponds with the agreed, prescribed medication dosing regimen provided by
a healthcare professional, is an important subset of the broad study of medical or treatment
adherence [12]. The lack of medication adherence poses a significant impact in increasing
the risk of psychiatric disorder recurrence and suicidality in adulthood [7,23,24]. Since
children and adolescents are still under the purview of parents or parental caregivers, hence
adherence among the younger age psychiatric patients are often times largely dependent
on the ability of the parent or parental caregiver to understand and follow through with
prescribed medication regimens [12].
Parental influence on children and adolescents’ well-being has been widely investigated. Parental influence is inclusive of all influences related to the paternal and maternal
figure, that affects the physical, emotional, and intellectual development of a child [25].
According to a review conducted by Rohden et al. [26], parental factors such as income, age
characteristics, family structure, parents’ well-being, parental care or neglect and parental
arbitration on child’s adherence towards treatment and medication are salient aspects and
can be seen as a risk or protective factor of a child’s well-being. Children or adolescents
with a psychiatric disorder may possess limited knowledge on mental health and lack
of ability in accessing the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), thus
requiring parental supervision and guidance in overcoming structural barriers such as
financial costs and logistical barriers, as well as adherence challenges such as monitoring
symptom severity and ensuring the medication is administered appropriately [27]. Overall,
parental factors can be seen as a crucial factor in maximizing good clinical outcomes or
causing a major health setback.
There are few reviews that have reported the role of parents as one of the factors
associated with medication adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric
disorder [10,15,16]. Both Edgcomb and Zima [10] and Häge et al. [15] investigated predictors of medication adherence only, while Timlin et al. [16] reviewed factors associated with
adolescents’ adherence to both medication and non-pharmacological treatments in mental
health. A total of 60 studies were reviewed in Edgcomb and Zima [10], Häge et al. [15],
and Timlin et al. [16]. The reviews concluded that the range of medication nonadherence was wide, between 6% and 62%, and was considered a common problem in mental
health care among children and adolescents with a psychiatric disorder. Factors such as
illness severity, comorbidity burden or underlying diagnosis, substance use, and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder, age, sex, interpersonal care processes and the adolescent’s
own beliefs towards treatment emerged as significant predictors of adherence. With regard
to parental factors, the findings from these reviews suggests that positive attitudes or the
level of support obtained from family members were associated with higher adherence
among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders [10,15,16]. Nevertheless, Timlin
et al. [16] pointed out the fact that it is challenging to ensure adolescents’ medication
adherence to prescribed treatment or medication regimens, as they are transitioning into
adulthood and tend to become more independent of their parents. However, these reviews
did not provide a clear synthesis of literature that highlights specific components of the
parental factors associated with child/adolescent medication adherence. Häge et al. [15]
also emphasized the need for future research that involves familial factors associated with
medication adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Thus,
the purpose of this review is to evaluate the peer-reviewed literature addressing specific
aspects of parental factors that are positively or negatively associated with medication
adherence among children and adolescents diagnosed with psychiatric disorders.
The specific questions addressed in this review were:

2. Materials and Method
2.1. Protocol
This review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO
(CRD42021256211).
2.2. Search Strategy
A search of articles published relevant to parenting and medical adherence among
children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders was conducted. The systematic search
of English language publications, from inception through December 2021 was conducted
using three main electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE. As shown in
Table 1, searches were piloted, and as a result, a range of search terms with broader
descriptions of parenting, medical adherence and psychiatric disorders were tailored to
meet specific requirements of each database. All searches were placed within titles and
abstracts to maximize the yield of a large data, ensuring as wide as possible a coverage
in the review. In addition, through chain searching, reference lists of systematic reviews
conducted by Edgcomb and Zima [10], Häge et al. [15], and Timlin et al. [16] were screened
and eligible articles were included in this review.

2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The systematic searches were designed to identify studies that investigate the relationship of parental factors and child/adolescent medication adherence, targeting all children
and adolescents, ages ranging from 1 to 19 years, who were prescribed medication for
psychiatric conditions. The present review included studies that (1) were quantitative;
(2) discussed any form of parental factor; (3) analyzed medication adherence as the outcome
variable (i.e., adherence toward observing instructions on taking prescribed medications);
and (4) were published in English or possessed English translations. Since this review is
confined to including quantitative study design term only, hence pilot, validation, psychometric, preliminary, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, qualitative, randomized-controlled
trial, interventional, and treatment-related studies were excluded from this review, increasing the robustness of findings derived from this review. Articles that discussed medical
adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders yet without including
any parental factor, and vice versa, were also excluded from the review.
2.4. Study Selection
A PRISMA flowchart documenting the process of study selection is shown in Figure 1.
After the removal of duplicate publications using the Endnote Program X5 software, the
study selection process was screened by two reviewers in three stages. All potential articles
identified for inclusion, from eligibility assessment of title and abstract, were independently
assessed. If the reviewers coded an article as potentially eligible, the full-texts were then
retrieved and reviewed to confirm eligibility. Articles excluded at every stage are agreed
to have met at least one of the exclusion criteria outlined. Any disagreement between the
reviewers were discussed with a third reviewer until a consensus was reached.

2.6. Quality Assessment
The quality of the paper included was assessed using the “Strengthening the Reporting
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)” checklist by von Elm et al., [51]. There
are 22 proposed items in the checklist, with items number 6, 12, 14, and 15 having specific
variations that assessed 6 components for cohort, case–control and cross-sectional studies.
The absence or presence of component stated in each item from the article will be graded
with a “0” or a “1”, respectively. A total STROBE score of ≥14/22 assessed for each
article are graded as ‘low risk bias’, while articles with a total STROBE score of <14/22
are graded as ‘high risk bias’. The results of the study quality assessment are shown in
Supplementary Table S1, where 16 of the articles were rated to be at low risk of bias while
the remaining 7 were rated to be at high risk of bias. Common reasons for loss of points in
articles were: lack of reporting on potential sources of bias; not addressing the handling
of missing data; lacking sample size justifications; insufficient description of statistical
analyses; and not reporting of effect sizes, confidence intervals, and funding details.
2.7. Statistical Analysis
Due to the differing data sources, heterogeneity and/or the small number of studies included in this review, a quantitative analysis was considered inappropriate and unsuitable.
Instead, a narrative overview of the data from included studies (e.g., study characteristics,
participants, outcomes, and findings) were presented with tabular summaries for an overall
description in this review. The data were synthesized by categorizing the components of
parental factors and psychiatric disorders the studies examined. Medication adherence
outcomes were extracted and used as the main findings for this review. All data in the
table were harmonized so that the influence on adherence refers to an increase in the
factor regardless of whether the factor is positive (i.e., associated with higher medication
adherence) or negative (i.e., associated with lower medication adherence).
3. Results
In total, 3006 articles pertaining to both parental factors and medication adherence
factors among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders were identified from
three databases: Scopus (413), PubMed (2044), MEDLINE (549), and chain searching (60).
Then, a total of 2531 unduplicated articles were further screened through title and abstracts.
Specifically, 532 articles were duplicates and 2265 articles were irrelevant. The remaining
40 eligible articles, after title and abstract screening, were reviewed in their entirety, resulting
in the further removal of 17 articles that failed to meet all necessary criteria: parental factors
were not thoroughly discussed [52–58]; target population was not the child or adolescent
population with psychiatric disorders [59,60]; outcome measures were not focused on medical
adherence [61–64]; and medication adherence was not measured based on administering
psychotropic medications [65–68]. Finally, only 23 articles were included in this review.
3.1. Summary of Study Characteristics
A total of 77,188 children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders and whom were
prescribed psychotropic medication were included in this review (Table 2). A majority
of 15 studies was conducted in the United States of America. There were two studies
conducted in Canada [38,48], and one study each conducted in Italy [28], Turkey [29],
Australia [34], the United Kingdom [41], Mexico [46], and Finland [49]. Even though
Harpur et al. [41] conducted the study in the United Kingdom, however participants from
Canada, Germany, Australia, Israel, Singapore, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Brazil,
and Malaysia participated in the study through the internet.
Participants were largely recruited from clinical settings, such as the inpatient (n = 10)
and outpatient (n = 8) clinical psychiatric facilities. Harpur et al. [41] and Pérez-Garza
et al. [46] recruited participants from clinics, yet specific services in which participants
were treated were not mentioned. Additionally, Harpur et al. [41] also recruited participants in the community though parent support groups and the internet. Similarly,

Healthcare 2023, 11, 501

11 of 32

Demidovich et al. [36] recruited participants through newspapers, radio advertisements,
and brochures sent to schools and local mental health centers, as well as program sites
affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. On the other hand, Bushnell
et al. [32] utilized enrollment files, inpatient and outpatient services, and dispensed prescriptions obtained from the MarketScan Commercial Claims database to identify and
recruit participants. Three studies recruited participants from a larger project or separate
study [42,44,50].
Almost all studies included in this review (n = 22) possess participants from the
adolescent age group. A total of nine studies recruited both children and adolescent
participants, with a minimum age of 3 years and a maximum of 18 years. Among the
included studies, Demidovich et al. [36] was the only study conducted among children only,
with ages ranging between 6 to 11 years old. The included studies employed naturalistic
(n = 4), prospective (n = 3), cross-sectional (n = 2), exploratory (n = 1), retrospective (n = 1), and
mixed-method (n = 1) study designs. The remaining eleven studies did not mention the study
design. The study duration was mentioned in nearly half of the studies (n = 20) included in
this review, and they were from a minimum of 3 weeks to a maximum of 3 years.
A total of 18 studies clearly reported the prevalence of medication adherence/
nonadherence among the children/adolescents [28,29,31–36,38–40,43–45,47–50]. The proportion of partial or complete medication adherence ranged from 27% to 78%, while the
proportion of medication nonadherence ranged from 8% to 69%.
3.2. Parental Factors Associated with Child/Adolescent Medication Adherence
Detailed information on the association of parental factors and offspring medication
adherence is presented in Table 3.
A few studies investigated the association between family socioeconomic status with
medication adherence among children and adolescents (n = 5). Socioeconomic status was
found to be positively associated with medication adherence in DelBello et al. [35], Demidovich et al. [36], and Harpur et al. [41]. Bernstein et al. [30] on the other hand reported no
significant association between socioeconomic status and medication adherence. Another
sociodemographic factor studied in conjunction with children and adolescents medication
adherence was parental education (n = 3). It was found that there was no statistically
significant relationship between parental education level and medication persistence or
commitment [29,37]. Even though Moses [44] reported a positive correlation (p < 0.05)
between parents’ education and youth’s commitment to medication, when multiple logistic
regression was utilized to evaluate the predictive value of the significant correlates, parent
education then demonstrated a non-significant statistical trend (p = 0.08).
Besides that, several studies investigated the influence of family living status on
medication adherence and found that there was no significant association [39,40,43,44,48].
In contrast, Atzori et al. [28] stated that youths with poor family structure or are not living
with both parents led to a lack of psychotherapy or educational resources to cope with their
mental health condition, which in turn made medication the more accessible treatment in
comparison to long-term therapy sessions.
Apart from family living status, the role of family functioning and relationship on
child or adolescent medication adherence were also investigated. In this regard, family
functioning or parental involvement in the child’s medication routine is a strong predictor studied in many articles related to child/adolescent medication adherence (n = 11).
All studies included in this review that investigated family functioning and relationship
reported that dysfunctional families, with the least affectionate parent–child relationship
predicting low medication adherence [30,37,42–44,48,49]. Regarding family support, there
were several studies that reported non-statistically significant relationship between family
support and child/adolescent medication adherence [36,38,40]. In a study conducted by
Gearing et al. [38], increased social support was not associated with improved adherence
due to the precipitated bias reported from excluding participants with high levels of family
support in the study.

The willingness of parents to ensure medication persistence is increased
when an excess of externalizing behavioral problems in children is
perceived.
In the cases of which treatment was discontinued, medication persistence
failed because parents did not want to give medication to their children.

There is no statistically significant relationship between educational levels of
parents and togetherness of parents with medication persistence.

being helpful:

The lack of proper family support, such as living with only one parent,
living with either natural parents or other figures such as adoptive
parents or guardians, grandparents, uncles, or in foster care, could lead to
a scarce availability of educational strategies, making medication the
main treatment.

Parental preference for a drug holiday on Sunday was allowed for about 75%
of the children in the study and it contributed to high treatment adherence.
High parental motivation to undertake the complex procedures such as to
receive MPH and intensive system of care provided by the clinic explains the
high rate of medication persistence.
â

•

Assessment Measures

Parents report on lifetime histories of psychopathology is non-significant and
can be considered less relevant to offspring compliance in comparison with
current psychopathology.
For both forms of therapy at each time point, parents were more likely than
adolescents to rate the treatment as helpful.
â
â

Parents may be in a better position to perceive positive changes in their
adolescents, or they may be more willing to give credit to treatment.
Parents play a crucial role in arranging, transporting, and paying for
treatment. When they view treatment as helpful, they may have greater
motivation to facilitate treatment compliance.

Assessment Measures

Children tend to have greater responsibility for medication
administration as they get older, yet the findings reinforce the importance
of maintaining some parental involvement in medication routines despite
the age of the children.

Poor adherence most likely occurs in children where parenting is shared
between more than one household, as this may involve disruption to
medication routines or parental differences in acceptance of medication use.
Poor family functioning that involves chaotic family lifestyles or parent
disagreements about diagnosis and management predicted low levels of
medication adherence.
Low family socioeconomic status (F = 4.5, df = 1, 70, p = 0.04) were associated
with nonadherence.
â
â

Ø The family SES was higher in medically adhered bipolar adolescents
compared with nonadherent bipolar adolescents (t = –2.1, p = 0.04).
Findings suggest that patients in families of lower socioeconomic status
may have limited access to medications and that the quality of care varies
among bipolar adolescents of different socioeconomic levels.

result, parents possess less of a perceived need for a medication
intervention.

Present finding also suggests, despite being a single-parent, yet without

follow-through.

follow-through, had less active/affectionate relationships with their
father than did subjects in the Med-COMPLETE subgroup.

office and discuss personal matters, especially among families with high
level of general dysfunction, a depressed parent, or an estranged
father-adolescent relationship.

Parental psychopathology:
â

â

Mothers’ depressive and paranoid symptoms have an impact on a
mother’s willingness to accept some responsibility for difficulties and
work on family issues, which may result in low treatment
follow-through.
Mothers’ high levels of hostility was associated with less medication
follow-up. Those in the Med-NONE (t [23] = 2.57, p < 0.02) and
Med-SOME (t [23] = 3.23, p = 0.004) subgroup had higher maternal
hostility scores than did those in the MED-COMPLETE subgroup.

Parent request of medication discontinuity

Adolescent’s family income (annual) was significantly related medication
adherence (x2 = 6.89, df = 1, p < 0.01).
Financial factors or limited resources, such as clinic hours and transportation,
remained a significant barrier to care-seeking and continued adherence to
treatment all of the time.
All adolescents in this study had insurance and did not have access issue.
Hence, making co-payments, calling in prescriptions, making trips to the
doctor and traveling to the pharmacy, should be taken into consideration, as it
can be an added difficulty for financially stressed families.

•

High perceived family support was significantly correlated with commitment
to medication.
Clinical or demographic factors, such as the out-of-home living status, and
with the exception of parent’s education were not significantly related to
medication commitment.
Youth classified as less committed to medication had parents who were less
educated (p < 0.05).

â
â

A stable and functional relationship between parents and their youth,
while demystifying the stigma associated with some psychiatric
conditions, could go a long way to improving medication adherence.
Improving the family dynamics and reducing the family’s sense of
overwhelming feelings related to the youth’s mental illness would
contribute to medication adherence.

Findings

•

â

•

•

Family conflict

Not mentioned

•

Adolescents adhered better to medicinal and overall treatment when the
family had better relational functioning.

A close relationship with the mother is a statistically significant factor in
predicting nonadherence.

•

The mothers’ attitudes towards treatment was not investigated and
remains unknown to whether adolescents’ mothers were opposed to
treatment.

•

â

•

Parents’ psychiatric problems, substance use, and employment did not
significantly correlate to adolescents’ adherence to treatment.

•

Family conflict predicted a failure of child/adolescent remission (Emslie et al.,
2010).
Parents and youth who were already being attentive to taking one class of
medication, will likely adhere to second medication also.

•
Woldu et al.
(2011) [50]

A statistically significant relationship was found between family relational
functioning (p = 0.029) and adherence to medicinal treatment.

This suggests that parents should monitor adherence to antidepressant

Parents’ psychological health, substance use, history of psychotropic medication or
psychiatric disorders and lifetime history of parental hospitalization were factors studied in association with their child’s medication adherence (n = 7). According to Burns
et al. [31] and Gearing et al. [38], current psychopathology of parents was associated with
lower medication adherence of their child, whilst a history of psychopathology was not
significantly associated. Similarly, Drotar et al. [37] stated that lifetime history of maternal
(r = −0.31; p < 0.01) and paternal (r = −0.44; p < 0.01) hospitalization for psychiatric illness
was associated with their child’s medication nonadherence. According to King et al. [43]
the mother’s depressive, paranoid, and hostile symptoms were associated with worse
medication follow-through of the child.
Similarly, Bushnell et al. [32] also reported that among the number of psychiatric
diagnoses that were evaluated in either parent of each child, parent substance use disorder
diagnosis was identified as an independent predictor of child’s adherence. However, in
contrast, Demidovich et al. [36] and Timlin et al. [49] stated that there was no significant
connection observed between parent’s psychiatric problems or substance use towards the
child’s medication adherence. Despite having observed a significant association between
mother’s depressive, paranoid and hostility symptoms towards the child’s medication
adherence, King et al. [43] did not fail to also report that mother’s anxiety symptoms
and father’s psychopathology were seen to be non-significant to the child’s medication
adherence. According to Bushnell et al. [32], parents’ psychological conditions may be seen
as a significant predictor to child/adolescent nonadherence. However, parents with psychiatric disorders who partake in preventative measures or healthy medication adherence
behaviors, such as taking daily medications, making trips to the pharmacy, and parents
well/preventative visits, encourage adherence in the child [32]. Consequently, parental
behavior or attitudes toward psychotropic medication is another major factor which was
studied in conjunction with child/adolescent medication adherence (n = 8). In a study
conducted by Coletti et al. [33], it was reported that more information is needed to confirm the association between perceived effectiveness and psychiatric condition medication
adherence. However, over the years, many studies have reported a significantly positive association between parent’s perceived efficacy and acceptability of psychotropic medication
towards the child’s medication persistence or adherence [29,31,41]. Parental self-efficacy,
resiliency, emotional support for the child, stigma, perceived costs of medication and parent
request of medication discontinuity are of the several parental behaviors that have been
reported to decrease the likelihood of the child’s medication adherence [36,41,47].
3.3. Definition of Medication Adherence and Nonadherence
The definition of medication adherence varied across studies, depending on the prescription of medication and clinical outcome. However, the definition of nonadherence,
as discontinuation or termination of medication at any given time, seems to be a commonly used definition in all studies. In a study conducted by Moses [44], medication
adherence is seen as an expression of commitment, hence the terms used to classify adherent and non-adherent youths in this study are “committed” and “less committed”.
In studies conducted by Ayaz et al. [29], Bushnell et al. [32], and Demidovich et al. [36],
“medication acceptors/medication persistence” or “medication refusers/discontinuation”
were some of the synonymic terms used to address adherence, however the term “compliance/adherence” or “noncompliance/nonadherence” were among the common terms often
used interchangeably (cf. Table 4). Majority of the studies (n = 20) included in this review
mainly attempted to investigate medication adherence among children or adolescents
with psychiatric disorders. However, there are three studies of which objectives were not
focused on investigating medication adherence, nonetheless were included in this review.
Demidovich et al. [36] reported significant effects of parental medication acceptability and
a child’s decision to accept or refuse medication recommendation after the administration of a modular psychosocial treatment, hence were included in this review. Similarly,
Hoza et al. [42] emphasizes the primary role of parents as implementers of treatment, indi-

rectly predicting the success or failure of children treatment outcomes. A study conducted
by Harpur et al. [41] was mainly focused on describing the psychometric properties of the
Southampton ADHD Medication Behavior and Attitudes (SAMBA) scale. Nevertheless,
this article was still included in this review due to the reliable and valid function of the scale
in measuring parental stigma that significantly predicts pediatric medication adherence.
All articles included in this review conducted quantitative methods in measuring
medication adherence of children and adolescents with psychiatric disorder. Medication adherence was assessed through questionnaires or scales in eleven
studies [29,31,33,36,38,40–42,45,46,48], structured or semi-structured interviews in six studies [29,34,39,43,44,47], manual or electronic pill counts in five studies [28,30,37,40,50], clinical measurements such as blood levels, serum concentration, etc. in three studies [30,32,37,50],
and hospital medical records in two studies [29,35,44,49]. In fourteen of the studies, adherence among children or adolescents with psychiatric disorders was assessed on the
basis of questionnaires or interviews with the parents, caregivers, or physicians. In a
study conducted by Dean et al. [34], medication adherence was reported primarily by the
child and verified by the parents’ report of their child’s medication adherence through an
open-ended question on parental involvement in medication monitoring. Similarly, instead
of solely relying on self-report medication adherence from patients, Goldstein et al. [40] and
Moses [44] also referred to Supplemental Data, such as pill count and medical records, as
part of an objective form in measuring medication adherence. Studies conducted by Burns
et al. [31], Harpur et al. [41], and Munson et al. [45] correlated the scores to ensure an agreement is reached between parent and child report of adherence. Likewise, Pogge et al. [47]
reviewed and corroborated adherence assessment with additional informant when patient’s
assessments appeared unreliable.

4. Discussion
The main objective of this review was to summarize existing evidence of the associations between parental factors and medical adherence among children and adolescents
with psychiatric disorders. This study also sought to summarize the definition of medication adherence as employed in the reviewed studies. The overall findings from the
23 studies included in this review reflect the ubiquitous impact parents have in effects to
the child’s medication taking behaviors. Since the number of included studies was low and
the quality of evidence varied across studies, the review only allows a narrow look at the
various factors of medication adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric
disorders. However, in comparison with three other systematic reviews conducted to
explore general factors of medical adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders, this review reports the results of a thorough investigation on parental
factors associated with children and adolescents medication adherence. Parental factors
were described in various aspects, the most common being parent’s socioeconomic background, family living status and functioning, parent’s perception and attitude towards
the importance of medication taking in treating psychiatric disorders, and parental
mental health status.
Most studies that investigated the relationship between socioeconomic status and
child/adolescent medication adherence showed a significant positive relationship between
the variables [35,36,41]. Socioeconomic background has been consistently associated with
disparities in child and adolescent mental health [69,70]. This review further confirmed that
socioeconomic status may have contributed to mental health disparities through medication
adherence. Families with low socioeconomic status may perceive the costs of mental health
medication and treatment as an additional burden instead of a need, hence leading to
higher levels of nonadherence [35,36,41]. However, reasons were unknown as to why lower
and lower-middle socioeconomic status families in the study conducted by King et al. [43]
reported higher rates of complete medication follow-through compared to other families.
The findings of this review emphasizes the importance of parent’s perception and attitude towards medication or treatment, which drives children and adolescents’ medication
adherence. Parents’ positive attitudes may influence the child or adolescent’s own attitudes
toward medication, which in turn predicted the latter’s adherence [16]. A study conducted
by Demidovich et al. [36] stated that parents with high self-efficacy and emotional support
were associated with medication refusal. Parents lowered sense of impairment related to
the child’s symptom severity and their perception of own ability as sufficient in dealing
with the child’s psychiatric disorders, reflects a form or parental resiliency, that resulted
in the low perceived need for any medication intervention or medication refusal [36].
Correspondingly, psychiatric disorders are often times subject to stigmatization and may
also provide further explanation to parents lowered sense of impairment of the child’s
symptom severity and lack of motivation to facilitate medication adherence. Stigma was
seen to be positively correlated with perceived costs of psychiatric medication and resistance which then directly discourages the child’s medication adherence [41]. According to
Atzori et al. [28], the psychiatrist’s approval of parental request for a weekend drug holiday,
as part of accurate treatment planning, have significantly contributed to high medication
adherence and progressively demystifies stigma and parent’s negative behavior or attitude
towards psychotropic medications.
Several studies have shown that parents’ current psychopathology or a history of
hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder was associated with lower medication adherence
among their offspring [31,37,38]. However, when the type of psychopathology was taken
into consideration, there were mixed findings, such as the inconsistent results found in
the association between substance use disorders and child medication adherence [32,36,49].
This may point to the relative influence of other factors ensuing from parental psychopathology. For example, parents with a current psychological disorder may be experiencing active
symptoms which leads to an inability to cope with the responsibilities of parenting as well
as the complexity of psychiatric treatment regime [32,43,48]. A history of hospitalization

Healthcare 2023, 11, 501

28 of 32

for psychological disorders may also indicate more serious psychopathology compared
with those with no hospitalization history. Parents with poor mental health may also feel
overwhelmed by the additional responsibility of caring for their child who is also facing
a mental health condition, and therefore may not be able to closely monitor their child’s
medication intake, thus leading to non-adherence among their children [48]. These findings
are important, as it shows the importance of providing parents who are also struggling
with a mental health condition, with adequate support and skills to ensure the successful
medical treatment of their children.
The studies reviewed showed that family living status was not correlated with the
child or adolescent’s medication adherence [39,40,43,44,48]. Instead, interpersonal factors
which permeated family functionality and relationships were more important. The findings
are similar to Timlin et al.’s [16] systematic review of factors contributing to adolescents’
adherence to mental health and psychiatric treatment, which included parental support
and family cohesion. Family functioning that are problematic or chaotic with low adaptability, least affectionate and uninvolved in the child’s treatment regime were significantly
associated with greater noncompliance with medications [30,34,37,43,44,48,49]. According
to Dean et al. [34], even though children tend to have greater responsibility for medication
administration as they grow older, it is important for parents to still maintain some parental
involvement in medication routines. Woldu et al. [50] further emphasized that parental
involvement in the child’s medication regimes should persist in not just younger adolescents but also in those who are distractible and forgetful. In contrast, Timlin et al. [49]
reported that the child’s close relationship with the mother is a statistically significant factor
in predicting nonadherence. The reason remains unknown and in need of clarification as to
whether the children/adolescents’ mothers were opposed to treatments [49].
The definitions of adherence and methods used in assessing medication adherence in
the 23 studies that were included in this review varied widely. Self-reported measurements
such as questionnaires and interviews with children and adolescents were used to obtain
information about medication adherence. Self-reported and subjective report of adherence
is a feasible method to obtain information as it is less costly and is correlated with clinical
outcomes [71]. However, the self-report methods have their weaknesses, including the
inability to ascertain the veracity of the reports, and not being able to control for over- or
under-reports of adherence [72]. Self-reported adherence may be even more problematic for
children and adolescents as they are vulnerable to responding in a socially desirable manner
and young children may have difficulty in understanding the concept and measures of
medication adherence. Therefore, corroboration of self-report results are conducted with
other-report (e.g., Pogge et al., [47]) and objective measures were also employed, such pill
counts (e.g., Atzori et al., [28]), clinical measurements such as serum concentration (e.g.,
Bernstein et al., [30]), and accessing hospital records (e.g., Ayaz et al., [29]). Therefore,
both subjective and objective measures of adherence are important, and should be used in
combination to obtain the most rigorous results.
4.1. Strengths and Limitations
One major strength of this review lies in the attempt to address the importance of
parental characteristics in effects to medical adherence among children and adolescents
with psychiatric disorder. There was a range of parental factors addressed in this review
inclusive of parent’s sociodemographic or socioeconomic characteristics, parenting style,
and family functioning, parent’s social characteristics such as perception, stigma and beliefs,
as well as parental psychopathology. Due to relative study of heterogeneity in differing
components of parental factors, a meta-analysis was not possible. However, the review
process was systematic and all studies included were assessed based on strict eligibility and
exclusion criteria to ensure all relevant articles were included in this review. In a similar
way, the diversity of medical adherence measures across the articles included in this review
were positively seen as a means to reduce or overcome information bias. Nevertheless,
it may have also contributed to varying results that prevented causal conclusions from

Healthcare 2023, 11, 501

29 of 32

being drawn. All the articles included in this review were limited to English peer-reviewed
and published articles in international databases, possibly leaving potential studies published in other languages as well as gray literatures and unpublished articles outside the
review. This thus affects the applicability of the review as it confines the generalization
of the findings. Consequently, further research is needed to address these constraints and
guide the improvement of medication adherence among children and adolescents with
psychiatric disorder.
4.2. Future Research
The findings of this review will be able to inform future research of the importance
of parental factors towards medication adherence. According to the second question addressed in this review, it is shown that parental characteristics, such as parent’s perception
and attitude towards medication, parent’s current psychopathology, and parental support
or family functioning are significantly associated with medication adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. In relation to that, adopting effective
positive parenting approaches, such as positive discipline parenting [73] and strength-based
parenting [74] that aims to cultivate positive situations, processes, and qualities in children
and adolescents, would facilitate the design of tailored strategies to improve adherence in
these patients. In addition, this study also found that parental attitudes toward medication
was associated with the adherence of their children. Therefore, future studies could investigate methods to improve parental attitudes toward medication. The findings that parents
with current psychopathology and a history of hospitalization for psychiatric disorder
may indicate the need to further investigate systemic and holistic intervention methods for
families dealing with intergenerational psychiatric disorders.
5. Conclusions
This study aimed to systematically review studies on parental factors that were associated with medication adherence among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders.
Results from total of 23 studies reviewed showed that medication nonadherence was a
highly prevalent and widespread problem among children and adolescents with psychiatric
disorders. We found that parents’ socioeconomic backgrounds, family living statuses and
functionings, parents’ perceptions and attitudes towards the importance of medication
taking in treating psychiatric disorders, and parents’ own mental health statuses were
significant parental characteristics associated with their offsprings’ medication adherence.
The present study paves the way for future research by allowing active participation of the
parents in improving the child’s medication adherence.
