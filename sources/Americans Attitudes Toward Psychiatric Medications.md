Americans’ Attitudes Toward
Psychiatric Medications: 1998–2006
Ramin Mojtabai, M.D., Ph.D.

Objectives: This study examined recent changes in attitudes toward psychiatric medications in the U.S. general population. Methods: Samples
of adult participants in the U.S. General Social Surveys of 1998
(N=1,387) and 2006 (N=1,437) were compared for opinions on the benefits and risks of psychiatric medications as well as willingness to take
them in hypothetical situations, including experiencing symptoms of
panic attacks or major depression and difficulty in coping with stress or
having trouble in personal life. Results: Public opinions regarding benefits of psychiatric medications became more favorable between 1998
and 2006. More participants in 2006 than in 1998 thought that medications help people to deal with day-to-day stresses (83.4% versus 77.8%),
make things easier in relation with family and friends (75.9% versus
68.4%), and help people feel better about themselves (68.0% versus
60.1%). The public expressed a greater willingness to take medications
in 2006 compared with 1998 for trouble in personal life (29.1% versus
23.3%), to cope with stresses of life (46.6% versus 35.5%), for depression (49.1% versus 41.2%), and for panic attacks (63.7% versus 55.6%).
Opinions regarding the risks of medications did not change between
1998 and 2006. Conclusions: Americans’ opinions toward psychiatric
medications became more favorable over the past decade, and people
became more willing to take these medications. These changes have
likely contributed to the increased use of psychiatric medications in recent years and will continue to do so in the coming years. (Psychiatric
Services 60:1015–1023, 2009)

T

his study examined recent
trends in opinions of the U.S.
general population about benefits and risks of psychiatric medications and willingness to take them.
Whereas the rapid increase in the use
of psychiatric medications in the
United States in recent decades has
been well documented (1,2), little is
known about changes in public attitudes toward these medications. A
study based on data from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and
National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), found that Americans’ attitudes toward mental health

treatment seeking in general became
more favorable between 1992 and
2003 (3). That study, however, did not
specifically examine trends in attitudes toward the use of psychiatric
medications.
Studies from other countries have
recorded more favorable public attitudes toward psychiatric medications
in recent years compared with earlier
times (4,5). For example, national
surveys in Australia found that compared with participants in the 1995
survey, respondents in 2003–2004
were more likely to view psychiatric
medications as helpful for treatment

of patients with depression or schizophrenia and less likely to view the
medications as harmful (5).
In similar population surveys in
Germany, the percentage of participants who recommended psychiatric
medications for treatment of depression increased from 29% in 1990 to
nearly 40% in 2001 (4). The percentage of participants who advised
against use of medications for depression did not change appreciably across
the two surveys: 36% versus 38%, respectively. The authors interpreted
their results as indicating a growing
concordance between the public and
mental health professionals regarding
views on the treatment of mental disorders (4,5). Furthermore, the authors attributed the changes in public
attitudes to improvements in psychiatric treatment, increased public
awareness and knowledge about mental disorders and their appropriate
treatment, and a general trend in society toward professionalization. Although the reasons for these changes
in public attitudes remain to be fully
understood, favorable public attitudes
are likely to exert a significant impact
on demand for such services in the
community (6).
The period since 1998 has witnessed a number of developments in
the United States that could affect
public attitudes toward psychiatric
medications. These include the expansion in the use of mental health
services and treatments (1,7,8), the
rapid growth of the direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals (9,10), the new findings about
the relative risks and benefits of antidepressants and antipsychotics for
both adults and children (11,12), debates about the value and impact of
the Food and Drug Administration’s
1015

black-box warnings about the use of
antidepressants by adolescents and
young adults (13,14), and revelations about links between pharmaceutical companies and academic
researchers (15,16).
An earlier study by Croghan and
colleagues (17) that examined public
attitudes toward psychiatric medications and used data from the 1998
U.S. General Social Survey (GSS)
found that most participants had a favorable view of psychiatric medications. The study reported here expanded and updated the findings of
that seminal study by comparing 2006
GSS participants’ attitudes toward
psychiatric medications with those of
the 1998 participants. This study further examined whether any changes
in opinion were more pronounced
about benefits or risks of medications
or were more pronounced for some
benefits and risks than others;
whether willingness to take medications varied to a greater extent for
some hypothetical situations than
others; and whether any changes in
opinions or willingness to take medications were more pronounced in
certain sociodemographic groups
than in others.

Methods
Sample
The GSS is a biennial cross-sectional
survey of behaviors and attitudes of
the U.S. general population. It is conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of
Chicago (18). The survey is administered in face-to-face interviews that
last about 90 minutes. In addition to a
core module, which is repeated in
each round of the survey and collects
basic demographic, behavioral, and
attitudinal information, various “topical modules” are administered in
each round to all participants or to
subsets of participants. For example,
the 1998 survey included a module on
religious affiliations and practices,
and the 2006 survey included a module on opinions about gun control.
Questions about attitudes toward
psychiatric medications were included in a health and medical care module in the 1998 and 2006 GSSs. A total of 2,832 adults participated in the
1998 survey and 4,510 participated in
1016

2006, with response rates of 76% and
71%, respectively. Questions about
attitudes were administered to 1,387
participants in 1998 and to 1,437 in
2006. The GSS was approved by the
institutional review board of the University of Chicago.
Assessments
Questions about attitudes toward psychiatric medications were somewhat
more detailed in the 1998 survey than
in the 2006 survey. However, to make
results of both surveys comparable, the
analyses reported here were limited to
questions asked in both surveys. These
comprised four questions assessing
opinions about the benefits of psychiatric medications, including helping
people deal with day-to-day stresses,
making relationships with family and
friends easier, helping people control
their symptoms, and helping people to
feel better about themselves. Two
questions assessed opinions about risks
of medications, including potential
physical harm and interference with
daily activities. Four questions assessed
willingness to take these medications in
different hypothetical situations, including trouble in personal life, difficulty coping with stresses, symptoms of
major depression (feeling depressed,
tired, or worthless and having trouble
sleeping and concentrating), and
symptoms of panic attacks (having periods of intense fear with no apparent
reason and trembling, sweating, feeling
dizzy, and fearing loss of control or going crazy). Responses were rated on 5point Likert scales ranging from
strongly agree, 5, to strongly disagree,
1, for opinions about benefits and risks
of medications. Willingness to take
medications was rated from very likely,
5, to very unlikely, 1.
The participants’ basic sociodemographic characteristics, including
gender, age, race and ethnicity, and
education, were also recorded and
adjusted for in the multivariate analyses. Several previous studies have
shown these variables to be associated with public attitudes toward mental health treatments (1,17,19).
Analysis
Analyses were conducted in four
stages. First, change across survey
years was examined for each ques-

tion. In a series of bivariate ordinal logistic regression models the rating of
opinion or willingness to take medications was the dependent variable and
survey year (0 for 1998 and 1 for
2006) was the independent variable
of interest. The odds ratios from
these analyses reflect the likelihood
of having a higher degree of agreement with the opinion statements or a
greater willingness to take medications in 2006 compared with 1998.
“Don’t know” and missing responses
were excluded from these analyses.
Missing data were found in 3% to
10% of responses, depending on the
specific question.
Further analyses showed a greater
number of cases with missing data
among black respondents and in the
group aged 65 and older. The median
percentage with missing values on
ratings of opinions and willingness to
take medications was 12% (range
5%–16%) among black respondents
and 15% (range 6%–22%) in the
≥65-year age group. Furthermore,
on four of the ten ratings, 1998 respondents had a greater number of
missing values compared with 2006
respondents. However, the median
percentage of missing responses in
1998 was 8% (range 3%–12%). Thus,
even in these groups with a higher
prevalence of missing data, the percentage was relatively small.
In the second stage of analysis,
opinions within each category (that is,
the two categories of opinions about
benefits and risks) were compared
with each other, as were ratings of
willingness to take medications in different hypothetical situations. Analyses were conducted with bivariate ordinal logistic regression models; the
ordinal response categories were the
dependent variable, and dummy variables identifying each question within
the category were the independent
variables. These analyses examined
whether certain opinions were more
strongly held than others and whether
the participants were more willing to
use medication for certain conditions
than others. In addition the interaction
terms of the time variable with these
dummy variables were tested. These
terms assessed whether changes in
time varied across different opinions
or willingness ratings.

In the third stage of analysis,
changes in attitudes were examined
in multivariate models that adjusted
for gender, age, race-ethnicity, and
education. To avoid spurious results
from multiple testing, the models
computed average scores for ratings
of opinions and willingness to take
medications. Furthermore, interaction terms of each sociodemographic
characteristic with the survey year
variable were entered into the models
to examine whether changes in time
differed across sociodemographic
groups.
The fourth stage assessed the association of the respondents’ willingness to use psychiatric medications
with their opinions about benefits or
risks of medications. Bivariate analyses were conducted separately for the
two survey years, and a multivariate
analysis was conducted in the combined sample. The summary rating of
willingness to take medications (the
average of the willingness ratings) was
the dependent variable in these ordinal logistic regression analyses. Individual opinion scores as well as the
averaged opinion scores were the independent variables of interest in the
bivariate models, and the summary
opinion scores were the independent
variables of interest in the combined
model. The multivariate analyses also
adjusted for the sociodemographic
variables noted earlier.
A level of p<.01 was used for judging the statistical significance of the
results. Stata statistical software, release 10.0, was used for the analyses
(20). Analyses adjusted for survey
weights, and all percentages reported
are weighted.

Results
Sociodemographic characteristics
A majority of participants in 1998 and
2006 were female and white and had
at least a high school education (Table
1). Although there were statistically
significant differences in age and education in the two samples, these differences were small. The mean and the
99% confidence intervals (CIs) for age
of the sample were 44.0 (CI=43.1–
45.0) in 1998 and 44.9 (CI=43.9–45.9)
in 2006; education averaged 13.3 years
(CI=13.1–13.4) and 13.7 years (CI=
13.5–13.9), respectively.

Bivariate analyses of opinions and
willingness to take medications
Participants in 2006 agreed more
strongly than those in 1998 with statements about the benefits of psychiatric medications (Table 2). Opinions
became more favorable at a statistically significant level on all items. The
one exception was the opinion that
medications help people control their
symptoms (p=.013), which was already strongly endorsed in 1998. The
percentages of participants who
thought (agreed or strongly agreed)
that medications help people to deal
with day-to-day stresses increased
from 77.8% in 1998 to 83.4% in 2006;
those who thought that medications
make things easier in relationships
with family and friends increased
from 68.4% to 75.9%; and those who
thought that medications help people
feel better about themselves increased from 60.1% to 68.0% (Table
2). Changes in opinions about medication risks were smaller, and neither
reached a statistically significant level
(Table 2). Participants were also significantly more willing to take medications in all hypothetical situations
in the later survey.
The percentages of participants

PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES ' ps.psychiatryonline.org ' August 2009 Vol. 60 No. 8

who were willing (likely or very likely)
to take medications because of having
trouble in their personal life increased
from 23.3% in 1998 to 29.1% in 2006.
The percentage who were willing to
take medications to cope with stresses
of life increased from 35.5% to 46.6%.
Those who were willing to take medications for depression increased from
41.2% to 49.1%, and those who were
willing to take medications for panic
attacks increased from 55.6% to
63.7% (Table 2).
Variations in ratings of opinions
and willingness to take medications
Within opinion categories (benefits
and risks) and willingness ratings,
time trends were similar across specific opinions and willingness ratings.
That is, the differences among specific opinions within each category and
among specific willingness ratings
were similar across the two survey
years (Figure 1). The analyses for
comparing different opinions and
willingness ratings were therefore
conducted with the 1998 and 2006
samples combined.
These analyses showed that the
participants distinguished between
different benefits of psychiatric med1017

ications (F=141.37, df=3 and 2,682,
p<.001). They were more likely to
agree or strongly agree with the statement that taking medications helps
people control their symptoms
(85.1%), followed by the statement
that it helps people deal with day-today stresses (80.7%), makes relationships easier with family and friends
(72.3%), and helps people feel better
about themselves (64.2%).
The participants also distinguished
between different risks of psychiatric
medications (F=164.36, df=1 and
2,640, p<.001). They were more likely
to agree or strongly agree that taking
medications interferes with daily ac-

tivities (43.3%) than that medications
are harmful to the body (28.0%).
Furthermore, comparisons of average ratings across opinions about benefits and risks of medications indicated a statistically significant difference
(F=650.45, df=1 and 2,714, p<.001).
Participants were more likely to agree
with statements regarding benefits of
medications than with statements regarding risks.
The participants also reported different levels of willingness to take
medications in various hypothetical
situations (F=320.79, df=3 and 2,751,
p<.001). They were most willing to
take medications for symptoms of

panic attacks (59.8% reported being
very likely or somewhat likely to take
medications), followed by relief of depressive symptoms (45.2%), inability
to cope with stresses of life (41.1%),
and troubles in personal life (26.2%).
Changes in average opinion
ratings and willingness
Despite variation within categories of
opinions and willingness to take medications, responses within each category were strongly correlated. For
opinions about benefits of medications, Spearman correlations ranged
between .42 and .60 in the 1998 GSS
and between .45 and .65 in the 2006

ranged from 1, very unlikely, to 5, very likely. All comparisons for 1998 and 2006 were significant at p<.001.
b Results of bivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses. An odds ratio (OR) greater than 1 indicates that participants who endorsed an opinion more

strongly were more willing to take medications, whereas an OR less than 1 indicates that participants who endorsed the opinion more strongly were
less willing to take medications. All ORs were different from 1 at a statistically significant level (p≤.01).
c Ratings were based on averaged responses to questions and ranged from 1, strongly disagree, to 5, strongly agree.

GSS. For opinions about risks, the
correlations between the two items
were .42 in 1998 and .49 in 2006. For
willingness to take medications, correlations ranged between .45 and .76
in 1998 and between .41 and .74 in
2006. Correlations between opinions
about benefits of medications and
opinions about their risks ranged between –.21 and –.31 in 1998 and between –.16 and –.31 in 2006.
In view of the strong correlations
within categories, ratings within each
category were combined and three
averaged scores were computed: one
for opinions about benefits of medications (1998 Cronbach’s α=.80,
2006 α=.82), one for opinions about
their risks (1998 α=.61, 2006 α=.68),
and one for willingness to take medications (α=.88 and .80, respectively).
Analyses using these averaged
scores revealed more favorable opinions about benefits of psychotropic
medications (unadjusted odds ratio
[UOR]=1.46, CI=1.19–1.79, p<.001)
and greater willingness to take them
(UOR=1.62, CI=1.34–1.96, p<.001)
in 2006 than in 1998. Change in average rating of opinions about risks of
medications did not reach a significant level.

Multivariate analyses
The results of bivariate analyses were
confirmed in multivariate models that
adjusted for sex, age, race-ethnicity,
and education. Survey year remained
a statistically significant predictor of
opinions about benefits of psychiatric
medications (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR]=1.46, 99% CI=1.19–1.79,
p<.001) and willingness to take medications (AOR=1.66, CI=1.36–2.02,
p<.001). In addition, women were
more likely than men to endorse
opinions about benefits of medications (AOR=1.23, CI=1.00–1.50, p=
.009), to disagree with statements
about risks (AOR=.69, CI=.57–.85,
p<.001), and to be willing to take
medications (AOR=1.25, CI=1.03–
1.52, p=.003). Participants from
racial-ethnic minority groups were
more likely than majority whites to
endorse opinions about risks of medications (AOR for black respondents=1.97, CI=1.46–2.65, p<.001;
Hispanics, AOR=1.86, CI=1.33–2.62,
p<.001; and for respondents from
other racial-ethnic minority groups,
AOR=2.07, CI=1.33–3.25, p<.001).
Black respondents were less willing
than others to take medications
(AOR=.54, CI=.40–.71, p<.001).

Compared with the participants
with less than 12 years of education,
those with more than 12 years of education endorsed opinions about risks
of medications less strongly (AOR=
.45, CI=.32–.62, p<.001). However,
the participants with 12 years or more
of education were less willing than
those with less than 12 years of education to take psychiatric medications
(for participants with 12 years of education, AOR=.71, CI=.51–.98, p=
.006; for those with ≥12 years of education, AOR=.73, CI=.54–.99, p=
.007). None of the interaction terms
with survey year were statistically significant, suggesting that changes in
time were not significantly different
across sociodemographic groups.
Opinions on effects of medications
and willingness to take them
In bivariate ordinal regression analyses within each survey year, greater
agreement with statements about
benefits of psychiatric medications
were associated with greater willingness to take these medications,
whereas greater agreement with
statements about risks were associated with less willingness (Table 3). Results from the multivariate analysis of

PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES ' ps.psychiatryonline.org ' August 2009 Vol. 60 No. 8

the combined 1998 and 2006 samples
in which survey year and sociodemographic characteristics were entered
along with averaged opinion ratings
as independent variables were consistent with these results. Participants
with greater agreement with statements about the benefits of psychiatric medications were more willing
to take medications (AOR=2.87, CI=
2.33–3.53, p<.001), whereas those
with greater agreement with statements about the risks of medications
were less willing to take them (AOR=
.61, CI=.54–.70, p<.001). However,
opinions about the effects of medications explained only part of the
change in willingness to take medications in this analysis because the coefficient for survey year remained statistically significant (AOR=1.55, CI=
1.26–1.90, p<.001), indicating that
variations across time in willingness to
take medications cannot be fully explained by changes in opinions about
the benefits and risks of medications.

Discussion
The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. First, the examination of benefits and risks of medications and situations in which persons are willing to
take medications was not exhaustive.
For example, a common concern of
many consumers of psychiatric medications is the fear of dependency on
medications, which was not assessed
in this study. Furthermore, perceptions of severity of illness and the resultant impairment, which likely influence attitudes toward the use of
medications, were not assessed.
Second, the 1998 survey included a
question regarding whether the participant or someone whom the participant knew had seen a mental health
professional. Participants who responded positively to this question
also reported being more willing to
use psychiatric medications (17). Because of the increased use of mental
health services in recent years, a larger proportion of the participants in
the more recent survey likely either
used services or knew people who
used services, which could partly explain greater willingness to use medications in more recent years. However, the questions about service use

and knowledge of others who have
used services were very different in
the 1998 and 2006 GSSs. Therefore,
the impact of changes in service use
on changes in opinions and willingness to take medications could not be
assessed.
Third, this study examined attitudes toward psychiatric medications
as a whole. However, members of the
general public appear to be able to
distinguish between different types of
psychiatric medication and their indications for specific conditions (5). Future studies need to assess attitudes
toward specific medication groups
separately.
Fourth, this study was based on attitudes measured at two time points.
Establishing time trends would require assessments at a greater number of time points. Fifth, the observed changes in opinions and willingness might be a result of changes
in the interpretation of the questions
across time. However, the changes in
attitudes and willingness ratings occurred almost uniformly on all questions, whereas one might expect the
changes in interpretation to affect
some questions more than others.
In the context of these limitations,
the results of this study reveal significant consistencies as well as changes
in public attitudes toward psychiatric
medications between 1998 and 2006.
At both time points, the American
public appeared to have a generally
favorable attitude toward psychiatric
medications. A large majority were of
the opinion that psychiatric medications help people to deal with day-today stresses, control their symptoms,
and make relationships with family
and friends easier. A majority also
thought that psychiatric medications
help people feel better about themselves. In contrast, only a minority
thought that psychiatric medications
are harmful to the body or interfere
with daily activities. Thus, overall,
Americans hold a favorable view of
psychiatric medications and their attitudes toward them have become
more favorable in more recent years.
The discrepancy in patterns of
change in opinions about benefits of
medications and their risks is intriguing. Research in other countries regarding variations in time trends in

PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES ' ps.psychiatryonline.org ' August 2009 Vol. 60 No. 8

attitudes toward the benefits and
risks of medications has produced
mixed results (4,5).
In both Australia and Germany,
participants in recent surveys were
more likely than those participating in
surveys in the 1990s to have a favorable attitude toward the use of psychiatric medications when presented
with case vignettes describing individuals with depression and schizophrenia (4,5). Furthermore, in the
Australian study, participants in
2003–2004 were less likely than those
in 1995 to rate antidepressants as
harmful for treatment of depression
and antipsychotics as harmful for
treatment of schizophrenia. The
trend in attitudes toward use of antipsychotic medications to treat schizophrenia, however, did not reach statistical significance in the Australian
study.
In the German study, which did not
distinguish between types of psychiatric medications, participants in
2001 were less likely than those in
1990 to advise against using psychiatric medications after reviewing a vignette about a person with schizophrenia. However, given a depression
vignette, about the same percentage
of participants advised against using
psychotropic medications in 2001 as
in 1990, similar to the GSS results reported here.
Unlike the Australian and the German studies, the GSS items regarding
attitudes toward medications did not
distinguish between different psychiatric medications or different psychiatric conditions. The comparison with
other settings is further complicated
by the growth of direct-to-consumer
advertising in the United States over
the past decade (21). Much of the advertising in the mass media about psychiatric medications describes the
benefits of these medications in
vague and qualitative terms (22).
Also, more information is provided
about benefits than is provided about
side effects (23). Future research
needs to examine whether these factors have contributed to the patterns
of change in opinions about benefits
and risks of psychiatric medications.
The consistency of findings in this
study with those of other countries
regarding more favorable attitudes
1021

toward the use of psychiatric medications in more recent years suggests a
global trend. The reasons for this
trend, however, are less well understood. Possible contributors include
the continued medicalization of individual and social problems, the introduction and wider availability of newer medications with arguably fewer
side effects (24–26), increased knowledge of mental health conditions and
their appropriate treatments as a result of media and information campaigns (27–30), and greater use of
mental health services and psychiatric
medications in the individual’s social
circle (2,31).
Not surprisingly, more favorable
opinions were associated with an increased willingness to take psychiatric
medications. However, whereas a majority of participants endorsed most
questions regarding the beneficial effects of medications, only a minority
expressed willingness to take them for
most hypothetical situations presented. As noted by Croghan and colleagues in their study of the 1998 GSS
(17), “Americans believe that psychiatric medications are effective at relieving symptoms associated with
mental disorders, yet they are relatively unwilling to use them in most
situations.” This relative unwillingness persisted in 2006.
It is also notable that opinions
about benefits of medications and
concerns about their risks could not
fully explain the change in willingness
to take medications across time, given
that the variable of survey year remained statistically significant in the
multivariate model. These findings
suggest that other factors besides
considerations about benefits or risks
of medications likely contributed to
willingness to take psychiatric medications. The role of these other factors needs to be explored in future
studies.
Another consistent finding in the
1998 and 2006 surveys was that the
participants were more likely to express willingness to take medications
for symptoms of panic attacks and depression than for conditions that do
not conform to specific psychiatric
syndromes, such as having trouble in
personal life or an inability to cope
with stresses. However, remarkably,
1022

willingness to use psychiatric medications increased in all four hypothetical situations. This finding is consistent with the finding of growing use
of antidepressant medications in the
community among individuals who
do not meet the criteria for mood or
anxiety disorders (2,32–34). Because
the prevalence of problems such as
trouble in personal life and inability
to cope with stresses is likely to be
higher than the prevalence of specific
psychiatric disorders, changes in willingness to take medications for these
conditions would likely have a large
impact on the demand for psychiatric
medications in coming years. This
finding calls for a more targeted and
selective approach in public information campaigns aimed at improving
public understanding of the proper
uses of psychiatric medications.

Conclusions
Traditionally, negative attitudes have
been among the greatest challenges
in treatment of common mental
health conditions in the community.
Therefore, a more favorable public
attitude toward mental health treatments in general, and psychiatric
medications in particular, is a welcome development. However, with
the increasing public acceptance of
treatments, psychiatry faces the new
and growing challenge of educating
the public and providers to correctly
identify conditions that merit the use
of psychiatric medications and to distinguish these conditions from selflimited stresses of daily life that do
not require medication treatment.

Submissions for Datapoints Column Invited
Submissions to the journal’s Datapoints column are invited. Datapoints encourages the rapid dissemination of relevant and timely findings related to clinical
and policy issues in psychiatry. National data are preferred. Areas of interest include diagnosis and practice patterns, treatment modalities, treatment sites, patient characteristics, and payment sources. The analyses should be straightforward, so that the figure or figures tell the story. The text should follow the standard research format to include a brief introduction, description of the methods
and data set, description of the results, and comments on the implications or
meanings of the findings.
Datapoints columns, which have a one-page format, are typically 350 to 400
words of text with one or two figures. The maximum total word count—including the title, author names, affiliations, references, and acknowledgments—is
500. Because of space constraints, submissions with multiple authors are discouraged; submissions with more than four authors should include justification
for additional authors.
