Abstract

Prolonged armed conflict has raised significant concern about the mental health of military personnel and veterans. Conditions
such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression affect approximately 14–16% of U.S. service members deployed to
Afghanistan and Iraq. Other prevalent mental health issues include suicide, traumatic brain injury, substance use disorder, and
aggression. Despite the availability of mental health services, stigma remains a major barrier to care, with nearly 60% of affected
personnel avoiding treatment. This review examines how stigma influences help-seeking behavior in military populations.
A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus was conducted using terms such as “stigma,” “health care-seeking behavior,”
“military personnel,” and “mental health,” limited to English-language studies published between January 2000 and
November 2024. Additional data were obtained from cited references and recent conference materials. The findings indicate that
stigma in the military manifests in three main forms: public, self-, and institutional stigma, each of which contributes uniquely to
reluctance toward seeking care. There is a consistent negative correlation between stigma and treatment seeking. Programs
emphasizing education, peer support, and leadership engagement have shown promise in improving attitudes. Initiatives such as
the Real Warriors Campaign and evidence-based treatments like Trauma-Informed Guilt Reduction contribute to reducing stigma
and promoting recovery. A multifaceted approach involving policy reform, anti-stigma training, and culturally competent inter­
ventions is essential to improving mental health outcomes and service engagement among military members.

Introduction

HIGHLIGHTS

Over two decades of prolonged armed conflict highlighted sig­
nificant public and professional concerns about the mental
health challenges faced by veterans and service members.
Among the highly recognized conditions, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and depression are well known, which affect
approximately 14–16% of U.S. service members deployed to
Afghanistan and Iraq[1,2]. Although the mental health challenges
in this population go beyond PTSD and depression, including
suicide, traumatic brain injury, substance use disorder (SUD),
and aggression[3]. These issues often arise from battlefield
encounters, extended deployments, separation from family,

Stigma prevents 60% of military from seeking mental
health care.
● Public, self, and institutional stigma blocks help-seeking
behavior.
● Untreated stigma-linked illness increases suicide and sub­
stance risk.

and the built-in pressure of military life. The impact of military
service on mental health is significant, as deployments and com­
bat exposure increase the risk of developing mental health dis­
orders. Additionally, extended separation from family, regular
reassignment, and the stress of adapting the military culture add
to the psychological strain[4]. While combat and deployment
have high association with mental health conditions, challenges
can also arise during routine armed forces duty. Mental health
symptoms do not always present immediately, but certain peri­
ods, such as near battlefield situations or shifts from military to
non-military life, are especially demanding for service members
and their families[5].
Mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, yet
many individuals, particularly in the general population, do not
pursue care despite access to proven treatments. A significant

number of people with mental health challenges lack necessary
assistance, mainly because of lack of awareness and the stigma
associated with mental health disorders[6,7].
Stigma surrounding mental health remains a major obstacle in
pursuing help and accessing professional treatment. Many peo­
ple with mental health problems hesitate to get treatment due to
the anxiety of being judged, misunderstood, or discriminated
against. This stigma often stems from public misunderstanding
and negative stereotypes about mental illness, which can create
emotional distress and social withdrawal for those affected[8,9].
About 60% of military personnel who experience mental health
problems refrain from seeking help, yet many of them could
benefit from professional treatment. Across military studies,
one of the most commonly cited obstacles to help seeking for
mental health problems is concerns about stigma[10]. This shows
that stigma weighing heavy over the lives of veterans battling
mental health issues. Despite their bravery in service, many face
severe criticism and unfair treatment because of their struggles.
This stigma acts as a barrier, preventing them from seeking the
vital support they need[10]. This narrative review examines how
stigma affects mental health care-seeking behavior among mili­
tary personnel and evaluates strategies to reduce these barriers.
It addresses the following key questions:

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Eligible studies were those involving active-duty service mem­
bers, veterans, reservists, or other military-affiliated personnel
and assessing any form of stigma – public, self, or institutional –
as it related to mental health help-seeking, treatment utilization,
or perceived barriers to accessing psychological care. Studies
presenting empirical findings in quantitative, qualitative, or
mixed-methods formats were included, provided they were pub­
lished in English within the defined timeframe. Studies were
excluded if they focused solely on civilian populations, explored
stigma unrelated to mental health, lacked sufficient empirical
data to inform the review aims, consisted only of conference
abstracts without full-text availability, or were non-research
commentaries or opinion papers. These criteria ensured that
only studies directly contributing to understanding stigmarelated barriers in military mental health care were retained.
Study selection process
The initial search yielded 1827 records (742 from PubMed and
1085 from Scopus). After removing 327 duplicates, 1500 unique
records remained and were screened by title and abstract. Of
these, 1300 were excluded for not meeting the eligibility criteria.
Full-text assessment was performed on 200 articles, resulting in
the exclusion of 160 studies due to reasons such as the use of
civilian populations, exploration of unrelated stigma constructs,
insufficient data on mental health help seeking, or methodolo­
gical limitations including unclear design or overlapping data
sources. Following this multistage process, 40 studies met all
criteria and were included in the final synthesis. The structured
approach enhances clarity and meets the reviewer’s request for
improved transparency regarding article selection. The detailed
study selection process is illustrated in the PRISMA flow dia­
gram (Fig. 1).

1. How do different forms of stigma influence willingness to
seek care?
2. What aspects of military culture, organizational norms, and
leadership practices contribute to mitigating stigma?
3. How do confidentiality concerns and institutional policies
shape trust in mental health services?
4. Which evidence-based interventions, including education,
leadership engagement, and policy reforms, effectively
reduce stigma and improve care-seeking?
By exploring these questions, this review aims to consolidate
current evidence and guide targeted approaches to support men­
tal health help seeking within the military population.
Additionally, the review will evaluate the effectiveness of mental
health awareness campaigns in encouraging military personnel
and veterans to attain appropriate care.

Quality assessment and bias considerations
A concise quality and bias assessment was performed to
strengthen the rigor of the review. Because the included studies
varied in design, a broad, narrative appraisal was used rather
than formal tools such as NOS or ROBINS-I. Each study was
examined for clarity of aims, appropriateness of methodology,
adequacy of sample selection, transparency of data collection,
and coherence between results and conclusions. Potential
biases – including selection bias, self-report bias, recall bias,
inconsistent measurement of stigma, and limitations inherent
to cross-sectional designs – were identified and considered
when interpreting findings. Heterogeneity in stigma definitions
and assessment instruments was also acknowledged as a source
of conceptual and methodological bias that may influence com­
parability across studies.

Methodology
Search strategy
A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus
to identify studies examining the influence of stigma on mental
health care-seeking among military personnel. The search cov­
ered the period from January 2000 to November 2024 and used
combinations of the terms “stigma,” “mental health,” “military
personnel,” “veterans,” and “help-seeking behavior.” To ensure
thorough coverage of the literature, reference lists of included
studies and related reviews were manually screened for addi­
tional relevant publications. All steps of the search and reporting
process adhered to the Transparency In The Reporting of
Artificial Intelligence in Research (TITAN-AI) 2025 guidelines
to ensure responsible use of AI tools in the conceptualization,
drafting, and refinement of the review[11].

Prevalence of mental health challenges in military personnel
Military personnel, including both active-duty and veteran sol­
diers, experience a high prevalence of mental health challenges
attributed to the distinct stressors inherent in military service.

Although PTSD is the most commonly observed disorder in this
population, other issues such as depression, anxiety, and sub­
stance abuse are also comorbidities seen alongside PTSD[12,13].
A meta-analysis conducted by Hines et al in 2014 showed that
7.1% of all US, Canadian, and British soldiers who were in
service in Afghanistan suffered from PTSD[14]. Furthermore,
a longitudinal cohort study of entry-level US military personnel
found that the prevalence of diagnosed depression increased
from 11.4% in the year preceding deployment to 15% within
12 months following return from Iraq or Afghanistan, based on
systemic medical record review[15]. SUDs, particularly alcohol
misuse, also continue to be a concern with higher risks in veter­
ans who are male, unmarried, and younger than 25 years of
age[16]. A systematic narrative review examined the prevalence
of psychiatric disorders among the West African military, high­
lighting a high burden of SUDs[17]. Alcohol use disorder demon­
strated a particularly high prevalence, affecting approximately
76% of individuals[18]. The prevalence of cannabis use disorder
was reported at 5.8%[19], while non-medical use of prescription
opioids disorder was observed in 3.6% of personnel[20].
Various risk factors contribute to the frequency of mental
health disorders in military personnel. The most significant pre­
dictors of post-deployment PTSD are accredited to the frequency
and intensity of combat exposure. A United Kingdom study high­
lighted several additional risk factors, including lower rank, being

unmarried, low education, facing low morale, and lack of unit
social support[21]. The risk is further heightened in the absence of
post-deployment psychological and social support[22]. Separation
from families, repeated relocations, extended lengths of deploy­
ment, and combat stress – along with exposure to life-threatening
situations – increase the risk of depression in both active-duty and
veteran military personnel[4]. Experiencing injury in combat or
witnessing death is strongly associated with suicide risk within the
first 6–12 months after leaving the military particularly among
veterans[23]. Moreover, the change from structured military life to
civilian life for veterans presents its own difficulties, with many
struggling to reintegrate into society and find employment.
A study published in 2022 highlighted the prevalence of men­
tal health illnesses among US soldiers deployed to combat zones
during 2008–2013. Figure 2 summarizes the results[24].
Stigma and its types
Stigma is frequently characterized as negative beliefs and atti­
tudes toward people experiencing mental health challenges,
often stereotyping them as incompetent and weak, leading to
them being discriminated against and treated unfairly[25]. There
is evident contrast between the mental health care systems of the
military and civilian communities, and even though stigma is
persistent in both, military values like strength and resilience

that have been ingrained in a soldier’s mind make it challenging
for them to seek treatment[26]. Stigma is further grouped as
public stigma, self-stigma, and institutional stigma, each playing
a distinctive role in the obstacles faced by people suffering from
mental health challenges[9]. Prejudiced societal perceptions
result in public stigma, also known as perceived stigma, and
the unjust labeling of people with psychological illnesses as
incompetent, which contributes to their feelings of exclusion or
ostracization by society[9,27].
Self-stigma is when individuals internalize the public’s biased
opinions, giving rise to shame, embarrassment, and reduced selfesteem[9,25,27]. The subsequent feeling of inferiority discourages
the person from seeking assistance for their mental health
issues[25]. Armed force members may adopt the military cultural
labels incorporating them in their minds as a personal weakness
to seek mental health treatment, further exacerbating the inter­
nalized stigma and the subconscious fear of being avoided or
rejected by important people in their personal lives[26].
However, personal beliefs are not the only factor in perpetu­
ating stigma; institutional structures also play a significant role.
Institutional stigma is when the company’s organizational struc­
ture is not designed to accommodate an individual who wants to
receive mental health care[28]. The system places disadvantages
for people that take the initiative to receive care in the form of
career ramifications and labeling soldiers as unfit for service,
demonstrating a lack of support from the institution itself[29]. In
an effort to evade the stereotype that seeking professional care
often brings, military personnel are frequently deterred from
engaging in help-seeking behavior[9].

a particular effect on the military community considering the
emphasis placed on resilience and persistence in the face of
mentally taxing circumstances.
Numerous studies show that among military personnel,
stigma around mental health is negatively correlated with treat­
ment-seeking behaviors and their utilization[30]. A cross-sec­
tional study conducted among members of the Japan Ground
Self-Defense Force utilized the 10-item Attitudes Toward
Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale–Short Form to
assess attitudes toward help-seeking behavior. The study found
that both public stigma and self-stigma were inversely associated
with help seeking, indicating that higher levels of stigma were
linked to a reduced likelihood of accessing mental health
services[31]. Activities related to seeking help and patients’ com­
pliance with mental health treatment have been associated with
stigma regarding mental health[32].
Military personnel with mental health issues often delay deploy­
ing to mental health care seeking with fear of being viewed as less
engaging, less self-assured, and emotionally unstable. This makes
them believe that others in the military will build a negative impres­
sion and stigmatize people who seek professional mental health
help due to which preconception, prejudice, and disparity against
those seeking professional psychological care can result. When
neglected, this frequently results in a rise in the prevalence of
serious mental health issues including anxiety, depression, sleep
disorders, PTSD symptoms, etc[33].
In contrast, in a study done by Rosen et al, it was found that
stigma did not deter veterans with PTSD from approaching psy­
chotherapy and paradoxically a higher grade of stigma even
reported more rigorous involvement from those already involved
in psychotherapy[34]. Furthermore, in another study, concerns
about stigma were apparent but did not appear to sway treat­
ment-seeking behavior. This finding, however, was limited by
a lack of formal validation of the method used to evaluate
stigma[35].

Impact of stigma on healthcare-seeking behavior in military
personnel
A significant factor that may be delaying people from seeking
help is the strong stigma associated with mental illness. It has

According to recent research, military personnel who recog­
nized a need for mental health support but did not seek treat­
ment were approximately 3.7 times more likely to attempt
suicide (adjusted odds ratio = 3.65) over the deployment-topostdeployment period[36]. Control procedures during their mili­
tary service, including disciplinary proceedings, health issues like
discomfort and pain, leadership disputes, duty zone transfers,
rank reductions, or administrative departure etc., are few chal­
lenges that members may encounter while serving in the military.
All these variables may raise the incidence risk of suicide, yet
treatment is frequently delayed because mental health care is
stigmatized[4].
Consequently, the stigma linked to military personnel seeking
medical help – especially for mental health issues – can greatly
affect their willingness to pursue necessary care. By addressing
this stigma, the military can enhance the overall well-being and
health of service members, benefiting both them and the military
as a whole.

Evidence-based therapies are also crucial in raising awareness
and addressing mental health issues among military personnel.
One such therapy is Trauma-Informed guilt reduction therapy,
designed to reduce combat-related guilt and stress[41]. It showed
promising results in reducing PTSD, depression, and post-trau­
matic guilt; however, further research is needed to confirm its
efficacy due to limitations with small sample size and thus
decreased generalizability.

Critical analysis of study limitations
While the reviewed studies demonstrate a negative relationship
between stigma and mental health, several methodological and
contextual limitations across the literature influence the inter­
pretation of this study. As a result, the direct association
between the stigma and military help seeking cannot be defini­
tively established. Although recent studies and correlations have
been reported consistently, it remains unclear whether high
stigma reduces help seeking or whether avoidance of mental
health services reinforces the perception of stigma. Since most
studies are derived from U.S. active-duty male personnel, with
comparatively fewer studies involving women, ethnic and racial
groups, or non-Western minorities, this restricts the findings’
application to larger international military contexts. It may
mask stigma processes that are specific to a person’s gender or
culture. Most of the studies examined stigma alone without
taking into consideration organizational and environmental fac­
tors that may interact, such as leadership styles, unit cohesion,
past disciplinary experiences, or the perception of the secrecy of
mental health care. Thus, this might suggest that stigma has
a stronger or weaker effect than it actually does, without con­
sidering social and economic factors. Collectively, these limita­
tions present significant factors to take into account. Even if the
data repeatedly indicate that stigma prevents people from
obtaining mental health treatment, the methodological flaws
show that additional thorough, representative, and long-term
studies are required to confirm and improve these conclusions.

Interventions to reduce stigma
Raising awareness through educational programs is not only
critical in lowering stigma by encouraging help-seeking beha­
vior, but it also plays an important role in preventing suicide
among military personnel. To promote early intervention, pro­
grams like the US Air Force’s suicide prevention[37] emphasize
mental health education and encourage mental health literacy.
A similar program is employed by the Canadian forces[38], which
includes a multi-faceted strategy to ensures that a service mem­
ber’s career or future chances are not adversely affected and that
timely care is sought.
Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. One useful
approach is obtaining firsthand accounts from military members
who have received mental health treatment[39]. This helps huma­
nize the problem and decreases anxiety about criticism that can
affect one’s career. Additionally, workshops and online courses
debunk myths and provide relevant support by identifying men­
tal health symptoms early so all personnel can comprehend the
need for early intervention.
Furthermore, a cardinal role in shaping attitudes toward mili­
tary health care is played by leadership and peer support pro­
grams. These programs draw attention to psychological wellbeing and foster a culture of support. When commanding offi­
cers and peers openly discuss mental health, it reduces stigma
and encourages help seeking. Real Warriors Campaign
(Psychological Health Center of Excellence, n.d.) is one such
program, which includes personal recovery stories from military
personnel to break down stigma.
Another important factor that may hinder access to timely
mental health care is confidentiality. Therefore, policies that
allow telehealth consultations anonymously are required. Also,
mental health professionals should be embedded in military units
to help members seek care without any fear of repercussions.
Off-base counseling and protecting medical records are other
confidential care options that further encourage early interven­
tion. In post-deployment health assessments, self-report surveys
are included, which sometimes fail to evaluate the full extent of
psychological stress faced due to social desirability bias. Due to
concerns of stigma, military members underreport symptoms. In
contrast, anonymous surveys yield more accurate insights by
minimizing the fear of judgment[40].

Future directions
Significant research gaps remain, particularly in the area of
gender-specific stigma, as evidenced by the lack of research on
female veterans, limited inclusion and focus on racial and ethnic
differences, and the underrepresentation of non-US populations
in existing studies. These areas should be the focus of further
research, alongside an urgent need for longitudinal studies to
better understand how stigma and mental health outcomes
evolve over time within diverse military populations.
A promising future direction involves leveraging emerging
neurobiological insights to enhance stigma-reduction interven­
tions. Stigma operates as a chronic social stressor, with measur­
able biological effects, including dysregulation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis observed in minority stress
contexts, such as blunted cortisol responses to standardized
psychosocial stress tests[42]. At the neural systems level, discri­
mination has been linked to altered connectivity in salience and
threat regulation networks, particularly the amygdala-prefron­
tal circuitry, which plays a central role in stress appraisal and
regulation[43]. Moreover, epigenetic changes such as methylation
in stress-responsive genes like NR3C1 have been associated with
634

social stress exposure and predict attenuated cortisol
reactivity[44,45]. By integrating these neurobiological mechan­
isms into intervention design, stigma-reduction strategies for
military populations can be more precisely targeted and poten­
tially more effective.

Conclusion
Countless soldiers and veterans refrain from seeking help due to
the fears of being deemed weak or facing professional conse­
quences. In order to prevent the exacerbation of prominent
mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, anxiety,
and SUDs among the military population, efforts to reduce the
stigma surrounding these concerns is essential. Addressing this
issue therefore warrants a multifaceted approach aimed at
enhancing mental health awareness and education among mili­
tary personnel by implementing comprehensive policies includ­
ing evidence-based anti-stigma media campaigns, structured
educational workshops, and accessible online training pro­
grams. Additional strategies – such as ongoing support and
training for military personnel and their families, peer support
programs featuring testimonials from military personnel who
have received mental health treatment, and anonymous tele­
health consultations and surveys – can help foster a more sup­
portive and informed military culture, ultimately improving the
overall well-being of service members. Despite the strengths of
this narrative review, several limitations must be recognized.
First, considering the largely US-centered literature used in this
study, the findings may not fully translate to military popula­
tions in other countries with different cultural, organizational,
and healthcare structures and thus limit generalizability.
Furthermore, the use of only published peer-reviewed studies
also raises the risk of publication bias which may overestimate
the impact of stigma and omit studies with neutral or opposing
findings.
