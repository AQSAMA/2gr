Abstract
Background: Mental health-related stigma is a global public health concern and a major barrier to seeking care. In
this study, we explored the role of stigma as a barrier to scaling up mental health services in primary health care (PHC)
centres in Lebanon. We focused on the experiences of Healthcare Providers (HCPs) providing services to patients with
mental health conditions (MHCs), the views of policy makers, and the perceptions of stigma or discrimination among
individuals with MHCs. This study was conducted as part of INDIGO-PRIMARY, a larger multinational stigma reduction
programme.
Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 45) were carried out with policy makers (n = 3), PHC manage‑
ment (n = 4), PHC staff (n = 24), and service users (SUs) (n = 14) between August 2018 and September 2019. These
interviews explored mental health knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of staff, challenges of providing treatment,
and patient outcomes. All interviews were coded using NVivo and a thematic coding framework.
Results: The results of this study are presented under three themes: (1) stigma at PHC level, (2) stigma outside PHC
centres, and (3) structural stigma. SUs did not testify to discrimination from HCPs but did describe stigmatising behav‑
iour from their families. Interestingly, at the PHC level, stigma reporting differed among staff according to a power
gradient. Nurses and social workers did not explicitly report incidents of stigma but described patients with MHCs as
uncooperative, underscoring their internalized negative views on mental health. General practitioners and directors
were more outspoken than nurses regarding the challenges faced with mental health patients. Mental health profes‑
sionals revealed that HCPs still hold implicitly negative views towards patients with MHCs however their attitude has
improved recently. Our analysis highlights five layers of stigma affecting SUs.
Conclusion: This qualitative study reveals that stigma was still a key concern that affects patients with MHC. SUs
reported experiencing overt stigmatising behaviour in the community but less explicit discrimination in a PHC set‑
ting. Our findings emphasise the importance of (1) combatting structural stigma through legal reform, (2) addressing
interpersonal stigma, (3) committing PHC management to deliver high quality mental health integrated services, and
(4) reducing intrapersonal stigma by building public empathy.

Background
Mental health-related stigma is a global public health
concern. It is considered a major barrier to seeking care
and ongoing treatment participation. Stigma may cause
fear and reluctance to seek help amongst people with
mental health conditions (MHCs) [1–3].

Stigma is an indication of shame that typically creates
unfavourable attitudes towards the receiver, leading to
derogatory discrimination when it is related to a person
with a MHC [4].It is a heterogeneous notion including a
spectrum of prejudicial perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours [5] related to a lack of knowledge that leads to ignorance and discrimination [4]. More specifically, stigma
is divided into two categories of variants: “experiential
variants”—including perceived, endorsed, anticipated,
received, and enacted stigma—and “action-oriented variants”—including public, structural, provider-based and
self-stigma [6] Stigma and discrimination connected to
MHCs have been portrayed as having worse effects and
causing more suffering than the mental health problems
themselves [7]. Thus, addressing stigma has been highlighted as a significant objective of the World Health
Organization (WHO) Action Plan 2013–2020 for mental
health [8].
Within the service delivery context, stigma is understood to function at three interlinked levels: (1) structural stigma represented by policies and legislations,
(2) interpersonal stigma constituted by issues related to
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of HCPs and one’s
community, and (3) intrapersonal stigma connoted
by negative beliefs about the self, including both selfstigma and internalized stigma [9]. Health professionals’ behaviour can affect self-stigma due to the effect of
interpersonal interactions [9]; for example, experiences
of self-stigma are amplified when health professionals
describe MHCs with stigmatising or judgmental terms
instead of actively attempting to understanding a person’s
experience with their illness [10].
In general medical settings, research has shown that
healthcare providers may express negative attitudes of
fear, guilt and aggression towards patients with MHCs,
which has a negative impact on patient care [11]. As
such, stigma appears to be a barrier to receiving compassionate treatment, even when the patients’ primary reasons for admission are unrelated to pre-existing mental
health conditions [11]. Some practitioners may hold stereotyped beliefs, so that they treat mental health patients
negatively, and may label them and perceive them to be
dangerous [12].
In low–and middle-income countries (LMICs), stigma
and discrimination towards individuals with MHCs
have led to a high prevalence of human rights violations
(including basic cultural, civil, economic, political, and
social rights) [13]. In Arab countries, stigma remains
largely understudied [14] and continues to be a significant obstacle to adequate mental healthcare provision
[15]. Another important problem affecting structural
stigma, especially in LMICs, is the scarcity of resources
in terms of funding, community resources and human

Page 2 of 14

resources.[16, 17]. Therefore, patients with MHCs may
not receive appropriate or effective care for their mental
or physical health due to poor staff training, inadequate
supervision, and other structural factors [9].
Lebanon is a middle-income country with an overall treatment gap of more than ninety percent in mental
health [18]. Lebanon is known for its political unrest.
The health system was overstretched due to the increase
of the population residing in Lebanon as a result of the
Syrian crisis [19] Mental health resources in Lebanon are
constrained despite the large need for mental health and
psychosocial support services [20]. In 2014, the National
Mental Health Programme (NMHP) was established
with the aim of reforming the mental health framework
and scaling up services. In reference to the first national
strategy “Mental Health and Substance Use Prevention, Promotion, and Treatment Strategy for Lebanon
2015–2020”, stigma remains a main challenge in enhancing mental health service use [20]. Based on the findings
precipitating the development of this national strategy,
stigma is considered a cross-cutting encounter across all
levels of care and is negatively impacting service development and delivery, as well as leading to discrimination [20]. The NMHP, in line with the national strategy,
has been working with their partners to integrate mental
health services into selected PHC centres by ensuring the
availability of essential psychotropic medications and by
providing mhGAP training and supervision for HCPs to
be able to screen, assess, manage, or refer mental health
cases when needed [20] However, this integration was
subject to budget availability as well as to other structural
challenges.
The aim of this study was to explore stigma associated
with mental illness at primary health care (PHC) centres
in Lebanon. It also aimed to inform a deeper understanding regarding the integration of mental health into PHC,
which is a cornerstone of the mental health reform plan
in Lebanon that started in 2015. This study thus intended
to deepen our understanding of the experiences of PHC
staff while providing services for patients with MHCs.
Furthermore, the study aimed to understand the experiences of patients with MHCs when attending PHC
centres, and whether they perceived any stigma or discrimination during their treatment. In addition, policy
makers were included to provide context regarding the
structure of Lebanon’s current healthcare system. This
study was embedded within a larger programme, called
INDIGO-PRIMARY, which seeks to develop an antistigma intervention resulting from cross-country findings that will support both staff and patients with MHCs
in primary care [21].
This paper presents results from the situational analysis investigating current processes at PHC centres in

Abi Hana et al. International Journal of Mental Health Systems

Lebanon [22]. These data are significant for understanding what should be done to decrease stigma and, in turn,
to improve mental health treatment and provide support for patients with MHC in PHC settings in Lebanon, where the number of Mental Health Professionals
(MHPs) working in the public sector is relatively low.

Methods
Design

Methods comprised the analysis of qualitative data arising from interviews with policy makers, PHC management, PHC staff, service users (SUs) (n = 45). The ethics
protocol was approved from Saint Joseph’s University
Beirut (CEHDF 1193). This study was nested within a
multinational study (INDIGO -PRIMARY) investigating
mental health stigma in primary care in seven countries
[22].
Qualitative interviews consisted of semi-structured
interviews using five different topic guides developed through the INDIGO-PRIMARY steering group
and tailored to the interviewee [22]. The topic guides
explored: provider knowledge about MHCs; implicit
and explicit attitudes and behaviour of staff towards
SUs; burnout; provider clinical competence and quality
of care; primary care staff training levels and training
needs; challenges of providing treatment; patient outcomes including experiences of stigma and discrimination during treatment; and sociocultural factors that
affect patient treatment (Table 1). The topic guides

Page 3 of 14

provided a list of topics, broad questions, and probes
to be explored, whereby the phrasing of questions was
locally adapted to Lebanon and accounted for cultural
and contextual factors. All questionnaires were translated to Arabic; the terms were adjusted to remove any
stigmatising expression using the NMHP glossary of
Arabic mental health terminology. Non—stigmatising
terminology was considered to reduce stigma and negative bias when talking about MHCs. Questionnaires
were tested by NMHP staff internally and adapted
accordingly.
A member of the local research team explained the
study to participants verbally and gave them an accompanying participant information sheet to read. All participants were asked to complete and sign an informed
consent form at the beginning of the study except when
the interview was conducted over the phone. The outreach process of participants was done through focal
point staff of PHC centres, tasked with describing the
study and obtaining the verbal consent of participants.
The interviewer would reiterate the explanation of the
study and the consent form to the participant when the
phone call was scheduled. The interviewer made sure the
participant had adequate time to ask clarifying questions
before the interview. Phone interviews were mainly done
for SUs who preferred so, and in these cases, consent was
taken verbally.
The participant information sheet and consent form
stated that participation in the study was voluntary, and

participants could withdraw at any time, and explained
the aims and nature of the study, as well as what was
expected from participants, in lay terms.
Participants

Selection of four PHC centres was done in collaboration with the PHC department at MoPH and the NMHP
team. The PHC centres were selected based on the following criteria: (a) having staff trained on mhGAP, (b)
having a high patient load to be able to interview an
acceptable number of SUs, (c) availability of MHPs to be
interviewed, and (d) location in Beirut and Mount Lebanon due to the convenience of these two urban areas. The
NMHP team coordinated with the focal persons in each
PHC centre (director of centres or management coordinators) who ensured the first contact with key informants
and SUs, who were chosen according to availability and
identification with one of our key stakeholder groups; no
other specific sampling method was applied. In accordance with the cross-country INDIGO PRIMARY study,
five categories of stakeholders were included in the
sample.
The first category was Primary care providers (at least
three participants per PHC centre), which included both
clinical and administrative staff. In this category, two
levels of providers and staff were interviewed. First-level
providers were those who work within primary care centres and who had received general rather than specialist mental health training (i.e. mhGAP training). Cadres
included were general practitioners, family doctors,
nurses, and other general paraprofessionals. Secondlevel providers were the administrative and support staff
working in the centres, who had direct or indirect contact with SUs.
The second category was SUs (at least three participants per PHC centre). Eligible participants were persons
with a diagnosis of a MHC attending one of the participating primary care services and seeking care for themselves. SUs diagnosis was purposively not asked, so as to
encourage frank disclosure by participants without fear
that confidentiality might be breached. They had to be
able to provide consent for taking part in the study and
aged 18 years or older but of any gender and nationality.
Participants whose current state of functioning inhibited
their capacity to comprehend the study, provide consent
and perform the research activities (as assessed by their
primary care doctor or health worker), e.g. SUs in psychiatric emergencies, were excluded from participation.
The third category was primary care centre managers or lead primary care clinicians (at least one per PHC
centre), i.e., the local lead for managing staff and services
provided at the primary care facility.

Page 4 of 14

The fourth category was affiliated MHPs (at least one
per PHC centre): MHPs who collaborate with the primary care facility, e.g., psychiatrists or psychologists providing services at the PHC centre.
The fifth category was programme managers and policymakers (at least one): local or national representatives
of health authorities, institutions involved in policymaking, or funding bodies relevant to primary mental
healthcare.
Data collection

Data were collected through qualitative interviews
(n = 45), Programme Managers and Policy Makers
(n = 3), SUs (n = 14), Nurses (n = 6), General Practitioners (GPs) (n = 5); Mental Health Professionals (n = 6),
Frontline practitioners (n = 4), PHC Management (n = 4),
and other staff (n = 3) (Table 2).
The data collection phase was done in two stages. First,
the NMHP team conducted 12 qualitative interviews
with HCPs and SUs between August and December 2018
in two primary care centres. Then the team tried, unsuccessfully, to interview additional SUs from these two
PHC centres. This was in fact a main challenge in the first
round of interviews, where SUs either were not available
since the MHP stopped working in one of the PHC centres or SUs refused to be interviewed or failed to show up
to a scheduled meeting with the interviewer. Reasons for
participants’ refusal were not disclosed to the research
team by the PHC centre focal point staff.
The second stage expanded on the work done in phase
one in order to gather more data from PHC centres
through more interviews. Since the recruitment of SUs in
the first round was challenging, we gave them the option
to be interviewed over the phone to ensure greater privacy and convenience. These additional interviews were
launched in September 2019 with new staff members in
one of the previous PHC centres, as well as in two new
PHC centres in Beirut and Mount Lebanon. In this phase,
31 individual interviews were conducted (for staff, SUs)
in the PHC centres as well as three other interviews with
policy makers and programme managers. All interviews
were conducted in Arabic and were held for an average
of approximately 30 min each. Findings for phase one
of these interviews were included in the cross-country
analysis [22], whereas this paper goes beyond this initial
sample to cover the perspectives of a larger number of
interviewees (n = 45).
Data analysis

Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated to
English by the NMHP team, then verified again in comparison to the recordings. All interviews were coded
using NVivo and analysed using a thematic coding

framework [23, 24]. The thematic coding framework
was developed jointly by all researchers across all sites to
frame multiple-researcher coding [22]. A code book had
already been developed in Tunisia, which included the
main topics in the interview guide and updates only to
reflect minor differences in the Lebanon site. Consensus

Page 5 of 14

coding was used to reach inter-rater reliability: each
coder independently coded each interview, then the two
coders met to compare and agree on final codes. All
codes were reviewed extensively by the project team to
ensure accurate coding and removal of unnecessary dual
coding.

Results
The main results of this study are presented under three
identified themes. The first theme is stigma at the PHC
level and focuses on stigma as expressed by both SUs and
by HCPs. The second theme is stigma outside PHC centres, as SUs experiences of stigma in the community, such
as social exclusion on the basis of their condition, were
more prominent and voiced openly by SUs. The third
level is structural stigma at the system level.
PHC level
Stigma as expressed by SUs

Across all PHC centres, SUs described positive experiences while accessing mental health services, including feeling accepted, respected, and well treated by the
Healthcare Providers (HCPs). Experiences of stigma
and discrimination within the selected PHC centres
were never mentioned in 14 interviews with SUs from
four PHC centres. The overall perception of staff behaviour from all PHC centres was positive in the way they
treat and respond to patients with MHCs. Only one SU
reported stigma in a PHC centre accessed prior to their
current care; however, the SU did not want to discuss this
issue further during their interview. Nevertheless, selfstigmatising behaviours and attitudes were voiced clearly
in the aforementioned interviews. Self-stigma impacted
SUs’ behaviour at the PHC centre; they described hiding their mental health conditions, their treatment
with MHPs, or their dispositions from other HCPs and
patients. According to one SU, self-stigma can also lead
them to refrain from going to the PHC for treatment.
One SU refused to acknowledge that he was receiving a
mental health service as this might have suggested that
he was insane. SUs belonging to vulnerable groups, such
as members of the LGBTQI community and Syrian refugees, reported being respected and heard in the PHC
centres with no incidents of discrimination mentioned.
SUs made the point to contrast their positive experiences
at the PHC centres with difficult and marked experiences
of stigma and discrimination in Lebanon overall.
“Staff members at the centre are able to feel my pain.
They understand my unhappiness.” (Service User1,
PHC4, Female).
“I keep my condition private. I do not want anyone
to know that I am seeing a psychiatrist.” (Service

Abi Hana et al. International Journal of Mental Health Systems

(2022) 16:23

User5, PHC3, Female).
Stigma as expressed by healthcare providers

HCPs including nurses, receptionists and social workers did not explicitly report incidents of stigma or discrimination against patients with MHCs, but described
the latter as violent, uncooperative or difficult, revealing
internalized negative views on mental health and implicit
stigma.
GPs and directors were more outspoken than nurses
regarding the challenges faced when working with
patients with MHCs. For them, they considered these
patients to be a burden that PHC centres did not want
to take on, continuously referencing accidents or crisis incidents caused by patients with MHCs to highlight
their violent behaviour. In addition, prioritization of
reaching target patient quotas seemed to be significant
to PHC centre directors, so that doctors often overlooked
mental health causes of patients’ symptoms in order to
increase patient turnover. The general attitude expressed
by doctors and managers towards patients with MHCs
seemed to be overwhelmingly negative. One GP even
reported that patients with MHCs need to be institutionalized, isolated from their community, and kept under
the supervision of the NMHP or the Ministry of Public
Health (MoPH), and not the PHC centre. A management
coordinator reported that, in the past, security officers
were often called in to manage and watch over patients
with MHCs, but later stated that treatment of patients
with MHCs has greatly improved. This improvement was
largely associated with appointment of a mhGAP trained
nurse as the focal person to communicate with patients
with MHCs in order to increase their acceptance of treatment and support in their centre.
Although the lack of SU experiences of stigma and discrimination in the PHC centres was encouraging, interviews with MHPs underscored some negative attitudes by
HCPs towards patients with MHCs. One MHP explained
that although HCPs’ attitudes may not translate into
actual behaviours towards patients with MHCs, their
curiosity to learn more about their disorders, share personal identifiers and talk about experiences with patients
broke patient confidentiality. However, MHPs mentioned
that the attitude and behaviour of HCPs towards mental
health SUs have improved in recent years, especially as
PHC centres grew their involvement in advocacy campaigns conducted by the NMHP at the MoPH, as well as
in other mental health projects. Therefore, full integration of mental health services at PHC centres will require
a long-term roadmap.
“It is possible that a patient comes in and he is very
irritated. He might shout at the staff and say obscene

Page 6 of 14

things, we immediately know that he is suffering
from MH problems… Usually they are nervous, they
might instigate a fight with anyone. You can’t say no
to them.” (Data entry officer, PHC centre 1, Female).
“A patient once had an anger fit and started to break
items at the centre. I lost two laptops along with
their data; so I had to buy two new laptops. The
patient did not wish to wait to see the doctor, so he
broke the laptops. There was another incident, which
involved another patient with mental disorders who
came to collect insulin for his mother. The patient
had requested more. This led to an argument. The
pharmacist resigned as a result. The pharmacist had
to request the support of the security officer for safety
reasons. I lost the pharmacist and I lost two laptops.”
(Director, PHC centre 4, Male).
Stigma outside PHC centres
Stigma as expressed by SUs in the community

SUs were referred to MHPs by clinicians at the centres
or decided to refer themselves. SUs reported they were
hiding their mental health condition from their partners, children and families for fear of abandonment,
stigmatising, or discontinuation of treatment. A brother
of a female SU threw her antidepressants in the garbage
when he learned that she was seeking help for her MHC.
Another SU expressed that her husband was unaware
of her MHC because she was afraid that he might leave
her if he knew. It was obvious that the social context surrounding SUs was often unsupportive. SUs were either
neglected or held responsible for their mental health
problems.
In an attempt to underline the reasons behind the
unsupportive familial and communal environment,
MHPs reported that religion, or at least some aspects of
religious practices and their intimate influence on people’s lives, often acted as a barrier for help-seeking or
acceptance of diagnoses by the patients and their families. One nurse also reported that the surrounding environment of her PHC centre believed that lack of religious
practice leads to MHCs. For these reasons, HCPs of
PHC centres suggested that working with religious figures was a way to help bring the patient to the centre for
treatment.
“My neighbours do not understand why my children
are so loud and that my children suffer from mental health problems.” (Service User, PHC centre 4,
Female).
“My husband tells me I am mentally ill and makes
fun of me.” (Service User, PHC centre 4, Female).
“Some people assume that the patient is going
through difficulties (or has depression) because the

Abi Hana et al. International Journal of Mental Health Systems

(2022) 16:23

patient does not pray. Some religious people think
that a person who has faith would not be affected by
life’s trials and tribulations. They think that instead
of seeing a psychiatrist the patient should pray”.
(Nurse1, PHC centre 3, Female).

Structural stigma

According to the interviews with policy makers, PHC
directors and healthcare providers, the factors influencing stigma at a structural level were lack of mental health
training, understaffing, lack of resources and lack of staff
care that are mainly affected by funding. Policy makers
find themselves facing two parallel challenges: a top—
down approach, starting with advocating for and revising existing mental health laws and securing a budget
for the NMHP, which is often overlooked in a country in
economic and political turmoil with far higher presumed
priorities. On the other hand, a bottom-up approach is
hindered by the very limited resources provisioned to
PHC centres, decreasing the impetus to add mental
health services. Policy makers advocated for a system
level approach, hinting that the entire care system needs
to be reformed.
GPs and directors particularly focussed on structural
barriers. They stated that the time invested in mental
health patients, be it for the initial assessment and diagnosis or the frequently needed follow-ups, was time that
could have been allocated to many other patients. HCPs
need more time with mental health patients in order to
effectively complete assessments and screening forms,
and to identify their diagnosis, since they are not mental
health specialists. In other terms, patient quotas per GP,
and their association with financial support, deter them
from taking on patients with MHCs, whose care is often
more time-intensive. Many healthcare providers did not
see their role extending to providing mental healthcare
or engaging with beneficiaries with MHCs, clearly stating during interviews that working with mental health
patients was not part of their job description. While
nurses were ambitious and enthusiastic with regards to
providing mental health services at the PHC centres as
instructed, these services added to their existing tasks
and increased their workload. Nevertheless, this was a
managerial decision that could not be refused. Several
nurses reported experiencing burnout from their work,
exacerbated by a lack of support from their PHC centres.
While some PHC centres agreed to grant one day off for
staff care, other PHC centres were advocating for them
to use their allocated days of leave if they needed to rest.
MHPs emphasized the need for further training on
principles and guidelines when treating mental health
patients. However, structural barriers go beyond the

Page 7 of 14

discontinuity of mental health trainings, which certainly
affected the knowledge of healthcare providers and their
skills to deal with patients with MHCs. These barriers
also include the interrupted and insufficient supervision provided to HCPs by MHPs. One GP mentioned
that with lack of supervision and no incentives for the
additional tasks, doctors will not be motivated or confident in their abilities to provide mental healthcare.
For instance, once one PHC centre lost their attending
psychologist, who was also in charge of supervising all
patients with MHCs, the unsupervised HCPs repeatedly
failed to record any MHC symptoms in a very vulnerable
population.
“In the past, supervisors from the MoPH used to
offer service providers at PHC centres with a lot of
support. Supervisors were providing essential support. We completed the trainings offered by the
MoPH a long time ago. Service providers are applying what they know. No trainings are being given at
PHC centres at the moment. Service providers might
have forgotten the content of the trainings that they
received. They have not received trainings in over
two years. Supervision is very important”. (Program
Coordinator, Male).
“When we asked PHC staff members to provide
mental health services, most staff members objected
because they did not consider offering mental health
support to be part of their job description”. (Program
Coordinator, Female).
“To be able to provide mental health at the level
of primary care you need to have a system level
approach, so this means that it goes way beyond just
training and supervision”. (Policy Maker, Male)
Based on these findings, our main insights are interpreted in the following illustration (Fig. 1). Our analysis
exposes five layers of stigma affecting people with MHCs:
(1) structural, systemic stigma, (2) implicit and explicit
provider-based stigma at the PHC level, (3) community
stigma, (4) family stigma and (5) self-stigma. Interestingly, at the PHC level, our summary of findings and
stigma reporting indicated differences in discussions
based on a respondent’s place within the centre’s hierarchical structure, implying a possible link to inherent
power differentials when disclosing such information.

Discussion
Community level

Although SUs did not report stigmatising attitudes at the
PHC level, these findings should be subject to further
investigation, because understanding the socioeconomic
backgrounds and the dire needs of all SUs interviewed
could explain the positive feedback we received from

them. The fear of losing a free or semi-free support
with all their medical related concerns could have influenced their answers, despite undergoing a consent process in which they were informed that care would not be
affected by the responses they gave. In addition, another
factor contributing to their exclusively positive descriptions of interactions with PHC staff could have been
social desirability.
Koschorke and colleagues (2021) [22] provide recommendations to address these potential sources of biases

when researching mental health stigma; they suggest
not conducting qualitative interviews in clinical settings.
Ideally, such interviews could be conducted in community settings, and persons with lived experience of MHCs
could be trained to conduct the qualitative interviews.
Another consideration is that PHC staff did not display
discriminatory behaviour when the patients were present
at the centre but waited the patients to leave and discussed internally their conditions and pointed on their
behaviours.

The low level of stigma within healthcare centres, as
reported by SUs, is also in line with a very recent study
in Lebanon by Karam et al. [26] that investigated barriers to care through a sample of representative household
adults: < 6% mentioned that stigma is a barrier to treatment. Rather, the greatest barrier to treatment is the low
perceived need, as observed in 73.8% of the cases.
On the other hand, experiences of stigma in the community were prominent and voiced repeatedly by SUs.
SUs felt unsupported by their community, families and
partners as well, experiencing discrimination, hurtful
labelling, and an internalization of negative beliefs about
the self. These findings are in line with a recent study in
Lebanon exploring cultural misconceptions about MHCs
among Lebanese university students, [27] which found
that 70% of the students believed that MHCs are taboo
in Lebanese culture and should be hidden from family
members. Several studies revealed widespread discrimination against patients with MHCs by family members,
relatives, neighbours and the community throughout
Arab countries, the MENA region, Asia and worldwide
(e.g. [28–30]). Very few individuals in Arab countries are
able to seek treatment from MHPs, and it may take years
after onset before they seek care [31, 32]. In line with
SUs’ reports and these aforementioned studies, it is clear
that the discrimination from family members towards
SUs would be an important topic for future research.
Other types of discriminatory behaviours linked to
nationality, ethnicity, and sexual orientation are intimately linked to development of MHCs. In fact, since
the start of the conflict in Syria, PHC centres in underdeveloped and marginalized areas became hubs of support for Syrian refugee families. With little and often
ineffective work done on social cohesion between already
underprivileged host-communities and the Syrian refugee communities [33, 34], the existing stigmatisation
based on nationality, culture and traditions exacerbated
the MHCs of these communities. Mental health problems were often reported to be directly linked to social
determinants such as living conditions and poverty [35],
as well as overt aggression from host communities (e.g.,
neighbours or employers) towards Syrian refugees and
other ostracized communities (LGBTQI).
PHC level

At the PHC level, many providers stated that recently
stigma in society had diminished significantly due to
increased knowledge and awareness around MHCs.
This could be a result of increased activities on different
fronts and from different MH actors to increase awareness and tackle stigma, including the work of the NMHP.
However, it is important to continuously address further

Page 9 of 14

interpersonal stigma by increasing the level of awareness
about mental health in the general public in Lebanon.
Contrasting reports from staff with those from MHPs
indicated that stigma related to MHCs remains a barrier to care. A comparison between the interviews with
nurses on the one hand and GPs on the other hand
revealed that nurses did not openly describe events of
discrimination against patients with MHCs, while doctors were more outspoken regarding this issue. They
clearly expressed that patients with MHCs were a burden
on the centre, and that their treatment should be handled by specialists or in institutionalised settings. The latter statement is in line with a study in Oman [36], where
both medical students and the public preferred that psychiatric care facilities should be located away from the
community.
These differences between nurses and GPs regarding
their degree of open disclosure of stigma may be a byproduct of their power and authority disparities, highlighting a pertinent power gradient in the medical field
[37]. In most Arab countries, the literature shows that
the reverence for physicians dominates over that for
nurses, forming a weak image of nurses in Lebanon and
the surrounding region [38]. Disclosing negative attitudes
toward patients with MHCs may place nurses at greater
risk for losing their jobs than physicians.
Primary care providers’ discussions of the challenges
of treatment highlights implicit negative attitudes
towards patients with MHCs. Some providers and managers shared such negative beliefs, such as believing that
patients with MHCs are violent and thus deserving of
blame for their conditions. According to the literature,
this perspective has previously been seen to be a conceivable reaction to the misperception that MHCs are a personality weakness or that individuals are to be blamed
for their disorder [39, 40]. Hence, this attitude may be
considered an indication that service providers have misconceptions without voicing them explicitly, an assumption that should be further investigated. Consistent with
findings by Ross and Goldner [11], the predominant attitude amongst nurses was that physical healthcare must
be prioritized over mental healthcare, as it is seen as an
additional burden to their job or was ‘not their job’. This
attitude toward primary mental healthcare is likely aggravated by the lack of financial incentives.
In regard to interventions, awareness messages should
be disseminated at the PHC level, particularly through
evidence-based interventions. The existing evidence-base
for high-income countries suggests that structured social
contact between healthcare providers and persons with
lived experience of MHCs has the potential to reduce
stigma [41]. One strategy that has been piloted in LMICs
is the Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers

Abi Hana et al. International Journal of Mental Health Systems

(RESHAPE) intervention in which people with lived
experience are trained using Photo Voice to tell recovery
stories. The visual recovery narratives presented by the
persons with lived experience as well as other forms of
structured social interaction of persons with lived experience are incorporated into mental health trainings for
PHC staff. A pilot study showed that incorporating these
social contact components into PHC trainings reduced
stigma, increased MHC diagnostic accuracy of HCPs,
and increased willingness to endorse and deliver psychological and psychosocial treatments (i.e., not solely rely
upon medication) [42, 43]. The RESHAPE intervention is
now being piloted in Tunisia, Ethiopia, India, and China.
This work highlights that assessments of stigma should
not be limited to only self-reported attitudes, but that
behavioural assessments such as clinical role plays [44]
and documentation of clinical services should also be
evaluated during stigma interventions for HCPs.
System level

As already mentioned, stigma can be implicitly found in
nurses’ and physicians’ behaviour. However, this stigma
can also be found explicitly within statewide policies
[11]. A study by Reed and Fitzgerald [45] revealed that
“mental healthcare may often be left till last, only carried out if there is still time, and only by those who feel
able”. This also confirms that discriminatory policies and
structural procedures prevent treatment seeking and
funding for mental healthcare, therefore heavily influencing structural stigma [30, 39, 46, 47]. Similar findings
regarding the overall importance of structural stigma in
shaping other forms of stigma have been identified in
other LMICs [48].
According to the interviews, training and supervision
were highly emphasized as key to improving primary
care providers’ knowledge on mental health and, in turn,
to reducing stigma. This is consistent with the review
conducted by van Boekel et al. [49], who highlighted that
training, supervision and policies will improve structural
factors and will have advantageous influences on the attitudes of HCPs. To intervene at a structural level, several
factors need to be considered, including the revision of
work policies, procedures, and job descriptions by PHC
directors. Example initiatives for addressing structural
factors include developing screening forms to identify
mental health conditions and revising HCPs’ job descriptions to highlight their responsibilities in identifying
and assessing mental health conditions. Other changes
may include reforming PHC policies to include antistigma and confidentiality provisions as well as clinical
and administrative mental health protocols. In addition,
directors should also consider incentives for PHC staff. It
is also important to ensure adequate infrastructure, such

Page 10 of 14

as the provision of secure storage of patient files for confidentiality and private rooms for consultation. Moreover,
it is important to address the wellbeing of staff and provide self-care, since high stress levels can lead to burnout
of HCPs [50]. Professional burnout has long been used as
an explanation for stigmatisation in mental health care,
and components of burnout, such as high emotional
exhaustion and feelings of low personal accomplishment, have been shown to be significantly associated
with negative attitudes toward mental health patients
[9]. Ultimately, especially given the impact that COVID19 had on mental health services, it is crucial to consider telemental health services as well as mobile-based
intervention such as Step-by-Step, an e-mental health
intervention by WHO and NMHP that was perceived to
be relevant and acceptable [51]. In future research, it is
important to evaluate whether newly implemented strategies, such as Step by Step, reduces stigma perceived by
patients with MHC.
The establishment of the NMHP in 2014 and the
launch of the first national strategy for mental health in
2015 [52] to reform the mental health system and scale
up services have significantly expedited the provision of
mental healthcare in PHCs. Although many changes have
been enacted at the structural level of the health system
in Lebanon [19], the total expenditure on mental health
from the MoPH’s budget remains very minimal, and is
mainly allocated for long-stay inpatient costs in mental
hospitals [18, 53]. With the country facing economic collapse and political turmoil, funding challenges continue
to inhibit the provision of adequate resources and training programmes, as well as interrupt the support and
supervision provided by MHPs to HCPs.
Strengths and limitations of the paper

This study included several trends within mental health
that were previously understudied. To our knowledge,
this is the first qualitative study in a PHC setting in
Lebanon where SUs, along with a wide range of other
stakeholders (n = 45), were interviewed about mental
health-related stigma. Whereas in previous research the
contribution of SUs had been ignored [4], in this study
there was a relatively significant number of SUs (n = 14)
which constituted around 30% of the total interviews.
Furthermore, this study offered the ability to triangulate
findings across a wide range of stakeholders and the capability to analyse results in a comprehensive approach. In
addition, having variety and heterogeneity within the
SUs sample enriched the study content and informed us
of the diverse, heterogeneous perception of stigma and
barriers related to the Lebanese context, since it included
respondents who varied by gender, and nationality.
Additionally, the present study also addressed structural

Abi Hana et al. International Journal of Mental Health Systems

(2022) 16:23

stigma, which has not been studied in relation to stigma
among primary care staff. An additional strength is that
our qualitative approach allowed for an exploration of
specific contexts and cultural indications of stigma which
have not been studied previously. In reference to EvansLacko et al. [54], only 11% of previous studies on stigma
selected a qualitative methodology, of which a majority
lack a concise definition of stigma.
The study is not without its limitations. Firstly, it was
conducted among four PHC centres in the Beirut and
Mount Lebanon governorates only, for convenience of
these areas, whereas other more underprivileged areas
(such as North Lebanon, South Lebanon, Bekaa and
rural areas) should be further explored in the future
and may reflect other important outcomes. Another
limitation is that SUs interview sample did not include
people with severe mental illness, as in general, PHC
centres are expected to treat people with less severe illness, nevertheless it is the case that occasionally PHC
staff are asked to see people with severe mental illness
due to their emergent nature. Furthermore, most of
our findings rely on self-reports from PHC staff. Contact with most staff members (front liners, social workers, nurses & GPs) were exclusively established through
their supervisors. SUs were also reached by contacting
PHC centres focal points, who then referred SUs to the
research team for interviews. This outreaching technique
might have impacted the results due to responder bias.
Although every effort was made to ensure confidentiality and assure SUs that their statements would not affect
their treatment, the fear of losing services might still have
affected some participants’ responses. A more direct
sampling technique without going through the PHC
centres may have reduced the risk of this bias occurring.
Another aspect that would impact results is the possibility of social desirability bias and the attempt of interviewees to avoid painting themselves in an unfavourable
light. Furthermore, previous collaborations and relations
between the NMHP and PHC service providers may
have reinforced the effect of social desirability. Finally,
this study portrayed a period before Lebanon’s intersecting crises, including its economic crisis, COVID-19 epidemic, political unrest, and the Beirut port blast, which
had a significant impact on many sectors, including
healthcare and mental health services in the country. As
a result, the situation presently may now differ from that
which existed prior to 2019.
Implications of the findings

This study may inform future interventions at the primary care level and will inform mental health training
programmes. It also provides qualitative findings that
support the framework for bridging the mental health

Page 11 of 14

treatment gap at PHC centres, and in turn improving the
integration of mental health services into primary care.
Future activities and further analysis of the interviews
can also be used to explore facilitators and barriers to
integrating mental health into primary care and suggest
interventions that can support this integration. In future
research, ethnographic and direct observational data
within PHC settings can complement interview findings.
Furthermore, combining qualitative with quantitative
methods may be useful for better understanding stigma
and reaching a larger sample, which could be compared
to studies within other settings in the MENA region and
worldwide. In addition, more detailed information about
the interaction between different types of stigma within
various levels in a health system may shed light on the
root causes of our findings. Future studies should examine the cultural and contextual factors informing stigma
in primary care with larger study samples and in different
areas to develop specific guidelines for cultural adaptations [55]. These findings can be used to inform adaptations of strategies to reduce MHC stigma among HCPs
[5].

Conclusion
Our qualitative study shows that stigma is a key concern
affecting patients with MHC. SUs reported experiencing
overt stigmatising behaviour in the community, but less
explicit discrimination in a PHC setting. Interviews with
MHPs, however, revealed that negative attitudes towards
patients with MHC still exist implicitly within HCPs.
Therefore, in order to decrease stigma and improve the
quality of mental health treatment in these settings, our
findings suggest new recommendations to tackle all layers of embedded stigma. First, structural stigma should
be addressed by revising mental health laws, ensuring proper funding, increasing human resources, and
changing policies to integrate MH at primary care settings. Second, interpersonal stigma should be tackled by
providing continual support and supervision as well as
regularly building the capacity of healthcare staff. Third,
management officials at PHC centres are invited to commit to delivering high-quality integrated mental health
services, and to give greater emphasis to staff care and
performance-based incentives. Fourth, we propose development of initiatives to address intrapersonal stigma by
building public empathy and enhancing capacity at both
the individual and community level, with specific emphasis on PHC beneficiaries. Finally, and building on the
findings of this study, we urge implementation of new
interventions to reduce stigma at each discussed level [7,
45, 56, 57], in an effort to holistically bridge the mental
health treatment gap.
