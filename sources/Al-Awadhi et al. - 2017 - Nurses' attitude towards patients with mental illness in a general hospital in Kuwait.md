Introduction: Stigma and discrimination have been reported to cause unnecessary delay in mentally-ill patients
seeking help, which adversely affects a patient’s outcome. The attitude of health care professionals has been described
as being, even more, negative than that of the general public, which worsens the prognosis for patients with a
mental illness.
Aims: The aim of this study was to describe the attitude of nurses toward mentally-ill patients in a general hospital.
Methods: All the nurses in the hospital were administered a 40‑item Community Attitudes Toward the MentallyIll (CAMI) questionnaire which determines whether the mentally-ill are viewed as “inferior;” deserve “sympathy;”
perceived as a “threat” to society or “acceptable” if residing in community dwellings. The analysis of variance was
performed to determine association of the four subscales with the individual characteristics, including age, gender,
education, qualification type, position held, contact and contact type.
Results: Out of a total of 990 nurses, 308 (31%) completed the CAMI questionnaire. The mean scores for the
authoritarian (2.85), benevolent (3.66), social restrictiveness (2.97) and community mental health ideology (3.48)
subscales reflected a negative attitude of nurses toward mentally-ill patients. The direct or indirect utilization of the
mental health facilities resulted in significantly higher authoritarian and lower benevolence scores, indicating a positive
attitude change in this group of nurses.
Conclusion: Despite the small size and selective nature of the sample, the nurses’ negative attitude toward the mentallyill patients provides useful baseline data for further large‑scale studies and underscores the need for psychoeducation of
different health care professionals, including nurses.
Key words: Arab, Kuwait, mental illness, nurses, stigma

INTRODUCTION
Mental health and well‑being are critical to the quality of
life of individuals and the productivity of communities.[1]
One of the major impediments to the realization of positive
mental health and well‑being is stigma and discrimination,
which can impact all aspects of an individual’s life.[2]
Thornicroft considers stigma to be an amalgamation
of (a) ignorance and misinformation due to lack of
knowledge, (b) prejudice flowing from negative attitudes,
and (c) discrimination resulting from social exclusion or
avoidance.[3] Research has shown that stigma contributes
to a delay in seeking treatment.[4,5] Some studies have
found that even in developed societies, about a quarter
of people go to a faith healer or member of the clergy
group for help initially before consulting a psychiatrist or
general practitioner.[6] Stigma and discrimination toward
those experiencing mental illness is the greatest barrier to
recovery and provision of effective care and treatment.[7]
It has also been reported that many psychiatric patients
experience discrimination by health care professionals,
including doctors, nurses and social workers.[8‑11] In fact,
some studies have found that health care professionals
hold more negative attitudes toward mental illness than
the general public, which further restricts the recovery
rates and quality of care,[12‑14] while positive attitudes in
nurses are said to inspire hope, encourage individuals
to take control of their lives and engage in proactive
decision making about their future.[15]
The focus on nurses is especially important as they are the
biggest group of health care professionals involved in the
direct care of patients, including those with mental health
problems.[16] A highly skilled, flexible, and culturally
aware nursing workforce can ultimately have a positive
impact on practice.[17] Studies looking at registered
nurses indicate that qualified nurses with higher levels of
education and those with specialized psychiatric training
have more positive attitudes than unqualified staff and
those without any psychiatric training.[8,18,19] For nursing
and psychology students, exposure to a psychiatric
setting during training and having personal contact have
both been associated with positive attitudes.[20‑23] Other
studies, however, have found no association of formal
psychiatric training and interpersonal contact with a
positive attitude toward mental illness.[24‑26] There seems
32

little consensus or understanding of the factors that
form and maintain either negative or positive attitudes
to mental illness. What is clear is that attitudes are
multifaceted and are likely to have a complex relationship
with an individual’s education, training and experience,
on the one hand, and his sociodemographic, cultural and
religious characteristics, on the other.[27] There are few if
any, studies in the Arab world addressing this important
question of nurses’ attitude toward mentally-ill patients.

Aims

The aim of the study was to describe the attitudes of
nurses toward subjects experiencing mental illness
and determine if the attitude was related to their
sociodemographic characteristics.
The specific research questions were as follows:
1. What are the nurses’ attitudes toward mental illness?
2. What characteristics are associated with nurses’
attitudes?

METHODS
Setting

The study was conducted in Mubarek Al‑Kabeer
Hospital, one of the six regional general hospitals in
Kuwait. The hospital has 509 beds, serves a population
of about 600,000 which constitutes about one‑sixth of
the country’s total population. The hospital is staffed
with 607 doctors and 990 nurses.[28] The approval of the
relevant research and ethical committee was obtained.
All the consenting nurses working in the hospital were
administered self‑rating questionnaires.

Instruments

The Community Attitudes Toward the Mentally-Ill Scale

The Community Attitudes Toward the Mentally-Ill
Scale was originally developed for use with the general
population but has since been used with various samples
of mental health professionals, including psychiatrists
in the United Kingdom and both nursing and medical
staff in China.[29‑31] Measuring several aspects of
attitudes, including perceptions of people with mental
illness and attitude to community care, it consists of
40 statements each necessitating a response to the level of
agreement/disagreement on a 5‑point scale ranging from
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Al‑Awadhi, et al.: Nurses’ attitude towards mental illness

The questionnaire is scored on four factors:
Authoritarianism is a view that people with mental illness
are inferior and require a coercive approach; benevolence
is a sympathetic view of those experiencing mental
health problems, based on humanistic approach; social
restrictiveness is a view that people with mental illness
are a threat to society; and community mental health
ideology (CMHI) supports the therapeutic value of the
community and acceptance of de‑institutionalized care.
Reliability for the scale ranges from Alpha 0.68 to 0.88
with construct validity also showing positive results.[32]
Three items were modified for the purposes of this study
to ensure that language would be gender neutral without
changing the original meaning of the items. For example,
the statement, “a woman would be foolish to marry a man
who has suffered from a mental illness, even though he
seems fully recovered” was changed to “a person will be
foolish to marry someone who has suffered from mental
illness, even though he/she seems fully recovered.”
The background characteristics of the nurses were
collected by an 8‑item questionnaire requesting
information about age, gender, highest educational
attainment, qualification type, the length of experience,
position held, personal contact with people with mental
health problems and proximity of contact.

Data analysis

The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (SPSS), version 22 (Armonk, NY: IBM
Corp).[33] The four attitude factor scores were calculated
by adding the ten relevant items for each factor and
dividing by ten to arrive at the mean score. The scoring
of each scale ranges from one (strongly disagree) to
five (strongly agree). The nurses’ sociodemographic
data were analyzed with descriptive statistical methods.
The continuous variable age and length of experience
variables were each collapsed into two equal groups using
the medians of each total sample (33 years for age and
8 years for experience) as the respective cut‑off points.
The distribution of the scores was reasonably normal on
all four subscales. However, some outliers were noted and
the five most extreme cases were excluded from the data
set. The four dependent variables including authoritarian,
benevolence, social restriction and CMHI were compared
between two independent groups using Student’s t‑test.
The Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was
performed to determine if there was an association of the
four subscales with individual characteristics, including
age, gender, education, qualification type, position held,
contract and contract type. To control for any observed
differences in the single variable and explore any

confounding influences that the variables may have on
one another, all variables from the individual tests were
entered as covariance into MANOVA.
For all tests, P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

RESULTS
The sample characteristics

The sample consisted of 308 nurses. Eighty‑three
percent were females (n = 257) and 85% (n = 240)
were non-Arabs in origin [Table 1]. The mean age was
34.28 years (standard deviation [SD] =7.8). Ninety‑one
percent (n = 283) of them held bachelor’s degree.
Fifty‑three percent (n = 146) of the nurses or their

families, friends or acquaintances had utilized a mental
health care facility. Eighty‑nine percent (n = 275) were
staff nurses with over 10 years experience. Fifty‑eight
percent (n = 160) had nursed psychiatric patients while
ninety‑one percent (n = 256) thought a psychiatric
outpatient facility was needed in the hospital.

Characteristics associated with nurses’
attitudes toward mental illness

The nurses reported no direct or indirect mental health
utilization that had significantly higher (P < 0.031)
authoritarian and lower (P < 0.043) benevolence scores
indicating that the mental health services utilization
resulted in a positive change in attitude toward mental
illness [Table 2]. The utilization of services by the nurses
themselves (P < 0.030) or by their friends (P < 0.043)
had a positive effect on the community mental health
scale while utilization of mental health services by their
acquaintance (P < 0.026) had positive influence on the
benevolence scale.
There were no gender‑related differences in authoritarian,
benevolence, social restriction, and CMHI mean scores.
Similarly, holding a bachelor’s degree had no significant
effect on the mean scores of the four subscales.

Nurses’ attitude toward mental illness

Overall, the mean scores on the four subscales reflected
the nurses’ negative attitude toward mentally ill
patients [Table 3]. On the “authoritarian” subscale, their
scores (mean = 2.85; SD = 0.38) were on the relatively
higher side (the higher the score, the more negative
the attitude), suggesting that the nurses may have been
regarding the mentally-ill as being somewhat “inferior”
requiring a “coercive” approach. The “social restrictive”
subscale score (2.97 ± 0.39) was on the higher side
(the higher the score, the more negative the attitude)
suggesting “disapproval” of the mentally ill residing in the
immediate neighborhood. The “benevolence” subscale
score (3.66 ± 0.46) was on the lower side (the higher
the score, the more positive the attitude), indicating
that they may harbor less sympathetic views of those
experiencing mental health problems. The “CMHI”
subscale score (3.48 ± 0.43) was again on the lower
side (the lower the score, the more negative the attitude)
suggesting their reluctance to accept the presence of the
mentally ill in the neighborhood.

DISCUSSION
Our results showed that the nurses’ attitudes toward mental
illness were generally negative. The negative attitudes of
34

the healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, has been
known to exacerbate peoples’ mental health problems
and can seriously affect their chances of recovery.[4,34]
In a conservative Arab society where the behavioral
disturbances associated with mental disorders are equated
with “social shame,” the negative attitude of nurses can
have a particularly harmful effect on the patients and their
families. Kuwaitis, like other Arab communities regard
spiritual (jinni) possession, the “evil eye” and sorcery as
possible explanations for changes in human behavior.
[35]
Psychiatric patients are regarded by many as “cursed”
individuals who having been afflicted with evil spirits, require
some kind of divine intervention by the faith healers.[36,37]
The families are often blamed for their relatives’ illnesses
and criticized for housing potentially dangerous or violently
ill relatives.[37,38] Many patients afflicted with mental illness
never get to see a psychiatrist and are instead dealt with
by faith healers. The presence of stigma in mental health
professionals in a society where religio‑cultural practices,
rather than the modern day multidisciplinary individual
patient care plans, determine the type and the nature of
mental health services can be especially damaging to people
with mental health problems.
A number of studies comparing nurses from different
countries have found “nationality” to be the main
determinant of difference in the nurses’ attitudes toward
the mentally ill patients. In a cross‑cultural study involving
five European countries, for example, Lithuanian nurses
were found to harbor a more negative attitude, while
Portuguese nurses had a more positive attitude. This
was attributed to the overall public attitudes toward
mental illness in the respective countries.[14] The attitude
of nurses in our hospital was even more negative than
those of the Lithuanian nurses. Since the stigma against
people with mental illness has been reported to be global,
prevalent and persistent.[39] The global trends, rather
than the “nationality” factor possibly explain the negative
attitude of our nurses as more than 85% (n = 240) of
them came from different countries, including India, the
Philippines, Indonesia and Pakistan.
The utilization of mental health services by the
nurses, their families or acquaintances had a positive
effect (P < 0.031) on their attitude toward mental
illness, supporting the positive influence of the contact
hypothesis. Similar findings have been reported by
earlier studies.[32,40] It has been suggested that contact
with the mental health services removes some of the
apprehension and myth commonly associated with
the nature of these illnesses.[41] Another possible
explanation of the positive influence of contact with

patients is the direct observation of the beneficial effects
of the therapeutic interventions and the usefulness of
their roles in relieving psychological distress, removing
thereby some of the uncertainty surrounding treatment
of mental disorders. Finally, the direct or indirect
suffering due to mental illness may generate empathic
concern for the mentally-ill.
Contrary to the previous findings, neither a higher
degree nor the seniority level had any effect, positive
or negative on our nurses’ attitudes toward mentally-ill
patients.[8,10]
It is important to mention some methodological
limitations of the study. The relatively lower response
rate of our sample, derived from one of the six regional
general hospitals in the country, may not be representative
of the attitude of the nurses in the general hospitals which
makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. However, to
the best to our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind

to address the attitude of nurses toward the mentally-ill.
The negative attitudes among our nurses highlight an
important mental health issue requiring the attention of
the media in general and the health care providers, in
particular. It is suggested that further methodologically
sound studies be carried out to address this matter so
that programs can be initiated aimed at public education
and the training of the health care workers.

CONCLUSION
The presence of negative attitudes among nurses in a
society where severely mentally-ill patients are regarded
as “cursed” individuals afflicted with “evil spirits,” can
have considerable adverse consequences for people with
mental illness resulting in lower self‑esteem, reduced
self‑efficacy and reduced prospects of recovery.[42] It
is therefore, important to initiate training programs
for the nurses aimed at promoting positive attitudes
and make them sensitive to the needs of mentally-ill
patients. Such programs can include inter‑disciplinary
seminars and reflective seminars challenging the
nurses’ assumptions and attitudes toward mental illness
and helping them understand multiculturalism by
providing a safe explorative environment through skilled
facilitation.[43] The evidence to support the effectiveness
of this approach is well‑established.[44] A similar program
which was launched in the United Kingdom Education
