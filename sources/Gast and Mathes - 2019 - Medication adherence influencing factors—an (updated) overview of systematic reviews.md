Medication adherence influencing
factors—an (updated) overview of
systematic reviews
Alina Gast1 and Tim Mathes2*

Abstract
Background: Non-adherence negatively affects the efficacy, safety and costs of therapies. Non-adherence is a
multifactorial problem. This systematic review (SR) of SRs (overview) aims to identify factors that can influence the
adherence of adult patients with chronic physical diseases.
Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE and Embase on June 13, 2018. We included SRs
on the factors that can influence adherence in adult patients taking oral medications for treating physical chronic
diseases. Two reviewers independently selected studies according to pre-defined inclusion criteria. Two reviewers
independently assessed the risk of bias with the ROBIS tool. Data were extracted in standardized tables previously
piloted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. We synthesized data in tables in a structured narrative
manner.
Results: We included 21 SRs on eight different conditions. We rated eight SRs to be at low risk of bias and 13 to
be at high risk of bias. Although higher education, employment, higher financial status and marriage/partnership
mostly showed a positive effect on adherence, the impact was unclear because of the high uncertainty of the
underlying evidence. The evidence indicates that socioeconomic status and social support might have a positive
impact on adherence and that belonging to an ethnic minority might have a negative impact on adherence.
Therapy-related factors (e.g., intake regime) and disease-related factors (e.g., duration) mostly showed no impact on
adherence. Analysis of gender showed inconsistent results. Age might have a concave relation to adherence, i.e.,
adherence is lowest in very young and very old people. Depression has a negative impact on adherence. Impacts
of other mental and physical comorbidities were uncertain. Co-payments (any or higher) have a negative impact on
adherence. In contrast, the impacts of medication costs and insurance status were uncertain.
Conclusion: This overview analyses factors that might impact adherence to oral therapies in adult patients with
physical chronic diseases. Our overview suggests that there is a social gradient in adherence. However, for most
factors, the evidence was not conclusive due to the risk of bias, inconsistency or imprecision.

Background
Medication adherence can be defined as the extent to
which a patient’s behaviour corresponds with the prescribed medication dosing regime, including time, dosing
and interval of medication intake [1, 2]. Non-adherence is
a crucial point for the success and safety of many therapies
[3–5]. Medication non-adherence is a widespread problem
that causes high costs worldwide [5–10]. Especially in
chronic conditions with long-term therapies, adherence is
important to achieve target outcomes but is often low [10].
Adherence is a multifactorial phenomenon that can be
influenced by various factors. These factors can be divided into five different dimensions: social and economic
factors, therapy-related factors, disease-related factors,
patient-related factors and health care system-related
factors [10, 11]. Some factors can have an influence on
intentional non-adherence (conscious decision not to
take the medication; e.g., because of high co-payments),
while others can have an influence on non-intentional
(forgetting) non-adherence (e.g., forgetfulness because of
mental comorbidity).
Insights into the factors that might have a negative influence on adherence are important for several reasons. First,
this information can support the identification of patients
at high risk for non-adherence. Second, it can support the
identification of possible adherence barriers that might be
eliminated. Third, it can support the development of individually tailored adherence-enhancing interventions.
The objective of this (updated) overview (systematic review [SR] of systematic reviews) was to identify those factors that influence adherence to oral drugs in patients
with physical chronic diseases. Given the considerable
amount of literature in this field, this updated overview
provides a current and compact overall view on this topic.
Methods
There was no published protocol for this overview. Unless otherwise indicated, all described methods were specified before conducting the overview. This overview
was not registered.
Information sources

This overview is a focused updated version of an overview published by our research team in 2014 [12]. This
overview is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of systematic reviews (OoSRs),
including the harms checklist [13].
We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Embase (via Embase). The
complete search strategy, including the applied search
limits, is provided in Additional file 1. In contrast to our
previous search filter, we included unspecific terms for
influencing factors (e.g., factors, predictors) as well as

Page 2 of 17

specific terms (e.g., gender, age) because we focused only
on certain pre-defined influencing factors (for the reasoning, see the “Study Selection” section). We anticipated that these parameters would lead to a higher
sensitivity compared with the search for the previous
overview version. In addition, the search was performed
without limiting the publication date. We performed the
search of the electronic databases on June 13, 2018. In
addition to the electronic searches, we crosschecked the
references of all included SRs.

Study selection

We selected SRs according to the following predefined
inclusion criteria:
1. Patients: Adult patients (≥ 16 years) with physical
chronic diseases. We considered every physical
chronic illness. We excluded SRs that analysed
children (if > 20% of the included studies analysed
children), and considered only patients with acute
conditions or considered only patients with mental
illnesses.
2. Medication: Oral drug intake (at least 50% of
patient population)
3. Exposure: Pre-specified (see the text below)
potential influencing factors for adherence.
We defined a factor as any exposure that is not
controlled by the study investigator
4. Outcome: Implementation adherence (correct dose,
timing and/or frequency of intake) [2]
5. Study type: SRs (definition: systematic literature
search in at least one electronic database and
assessment and documentation of risk of bias
of included studies) of quantitative studies
6. Publication language: English or German
We aimed to summarize the evidence for factors that
are widely applicable across different conditions, therapies
and regions/settings. Therefore, we limited our overview
to unrelated factors of therapy and disease, i.e., we excluded factors that likely strongly vary depending on disease (e.g., symptoms), therapy (e.g., side effects) or health
care system (e.g., insurance type). Compared with the
previous version, we narrowed the scope by considering
only factors for which there were some indices for an influence in the previous broad overview [12]. We chose the
following factors: age, gender, ethnic status, education,
employment, financial status/income, marital status/not
living alone, social support, measure of intake complexity
(e.g., number of tablets, number of medications, frequency
of intake), duration of therapy, duration of disease, comorbidity, co-payments, medication costs and insurance status (insured/not insured).

In addition to these pre-defined eligibility criteria, a
further criterion was defined post hoc during study selection. Both reviewers agreed to exclude those SRs that reported only the number of statistically significant studies
(e.g., 10 studies showed a statistically significant effect of
gender) without reporting effect sizes and the total number
of studies on a certain comparison (e.g., 12 studies analysed
gender). The decision to exclude studies that were reported
in this way was made because the results could have been
highly biased by selective reporting otherwise.
The study selection (title/abstract screening and full-text
screening) was performed by two reviewers independently.
Any differences between the reviewers were discussed until
consensus.

4: synthesis and findings) and aims to identify biased areas
in the SRs. In the final phase 3, the assessor judges whether
the whole SRs is at risk of bias. In addition to the results of
phase 2, three additional signalling questions should be
considered in phase 3. These three signalling questions
refer to the discussion/interpretation of the SRs. We did
not extract any data from the discussion/interpretation;
therefore, we did not consider these signalling questions in
the overall judgement. Thus, the overall judgement of risk
of bias is exclusively based on the results of phase 2 [17].
The ROBIS tool was applied by two independent reviewers
(TM, AG). Disagreements were resolved by discussion. TM
was also an author of two of the included SRs. To ensure
an objective assessment, the risk of bias assessment of these
SRs was performed by a reviewer other than TM.

Data collection

All data were extracted using standardized extraction
forms piloted beforehand. Data were extracted by one
reviewer, and completeness and accuracy were verified
by a second reviewer. Any disagreements were discussed
until consensus. For each SR, we extracted the following
characteristics: condition/medication, eligibility criteria
for primary studies (only other than our applied inclusion criteria), search period and any search limits.
The results were extracted according to the type of evidence
synthesis. For all meta-analyses, we extracted pooled effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals, tests and measures for
statistical heterogeneity, the number of included studies and
the number of patients included in the meta-analyses. In the
case that the included SR performed only a narrative synthesis,
we used modified vote counting to extract the results. This
method has been suggested for presenting results of quantitative synthesis and overcoming problems of simple vote counting [14, 15]. We extracted information on the effect direction,
total number of included primary studies showing a certain effect direction, statistical significance of primary studies (p <
0.05) showing the effect direction and total number of primary
studies that analysed a certain factor.
All data in the tables were harmonized so that the influence on adherence (not non-adherence) refers to an increase
in the factor regardless of whether the factor is positive (e.g.,
socioeconomic status) or negative (e.g., co-payments).
Risk of bias assessment of individual studies and across studies

We used the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS)
tool to assess the included SRs [16]. The ROBIS tool is
based on three phases. Phase 1 aims to assess the relevance
of the SR. For this purpose, the relevance of the research
question should be assessed. This optional phase was
skipped in this overview because the relevance was already
completely covered by the eligibility criteria. Phase 2 comprises four different domains (domain 1: study eligibility
criteria, domain 2: identification and selection of studies,
domain 3: data collection and study appraisal, and domain

Synthesis of results

For all factors, a summary evaluation of the influence on
adherence across SRs was made. The evidence for an
impact was rated by considering the following criteria
that were inspired by the GRADE [18] criteria.
– Risk of bias of the included SRs and their included
primary studies. In primary studies, we considered
in particular adjustment for confounding, missing
data and adherence measurements
– Imprecision (statistical certainty, amount of
information on a certain factor [number of primary
studies and SRs, effect size)])
– Inconsistency (within and between SRs, e.g., due to
different adherence measures)
Based on these criteria, the effects were rated as robust
evidence for an impact, some evidence for an impact,
probably no impact or uncertain impact. The impact rating was performed by two reviewers.
Overlaps (multiple included primary studies) were
assessed by creating a cross table of all included SRs and
their primary studies. In addition, the corrected covered
area (CCA) was calculated. The CCA is a value that indicates the proportion of overlapping primary studies. It
ðN−rÞ
is calculated as follows: CCA ¼ ðrc−rÞ
; N = number of
primary studies (includes multiple counting); r = number
of index studies (defined as first-time primary study);
and c = number of included systematic reviews. The
CCA can assume a value between 0 and 100%. The
smaller the value is, the lower the overlap. Conversely,
the higher the value is, the greater the overlap [19].

Results
Study selection

The electronic literature research resulted in 4849 hits after
removal of duplicates (including hits from the previous

Gast and Mathes Systematic Reviews

search). After title and abstract screening, 4702 articles
were excluded, and 147 were judged to be potentially relevant. The full texts of these articles were screened in detail.
Fifteen SRs met all eligibility criteria and were included in
this overview. Most SRs were excluded because a methodological quality assessment of the included primary studies was not performed or factors other than our
pre-specified influencing factors were investigated. In
addition to the 15 newly identified relevant SRs, six SR of
the previous overview were included. Finally, 21 SRs were
included in this overview [20–40]. The process of study selection is illustrated in the PRISMA flowchart [41] (Fig. 1).

diseases [20]. Sinnott et al. did not restrict the condition or
medication but included all studies on publicly insured patients who were exposed to co-payments for medications
[40]. Of the 21 included SRs, 14 only synthesized the results narratively, and seven performed a meta-analysis. The
characteristics of all included SRs are presented in Table 1.
A list of excluded studies is available in Additional file 2.
The 21 SRs included 313 primary studies, and data
from these studies were used in this evidence synthesis.
The number of index publications was 285 (r = 285),
which resulted in a primary study overlap estimated by
the CCA of approximately 0.5%. The cross table can be
found in Additional file 3.

Characteristics of the included systematic reviews

The following conditions and medications were considered: chronic non-malignant pain [35], cardiovascular diseases (e.g., coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes
mellitus) [21–26, 29, 30, 33, 37], Parkinson disease [36],
hepatitis C [27], oral anticancer agents [28, 39], inflammatory arthritis [38], HIV/AIDS [31, 32, 34] and chronic

Risk of bias of the included systematic reviews

Risk of bias across the SRs was lowest in domain 3 (data
collection and study appraisal). In this domain, six SRs
were judged to be at high risk of bias. Compared with
domain 3, the other domains, including 1 (eligibility criteria), 2 (identification and selection of studies) and 4

(synthesis), were at higher risk of bias across studies. In
all these domains, more than 50% of the SRs were at
high risk of bias. In particular, imprecise eligibility criteria, inadequate restrictions in the eligibility criteria, inappropriate search strategies, simple vote-counting and
no protocols available were the most common reasons
for the high risk of bias in these domains. Figure 2
shows the results of the phase 2 ROBIS rating according
to the four different domains.
A comparison of the individual SRs shows that only
three SRs were at low risk of bias in all four domains
[25, 27, 28]. In contrast, 2/3 of all included SRs were at
high risk of bias in two or three domains [20, 21, 23, 24,
26, 30, 33, 35, 37–39]. Three SRs were rated to be at

high risk of bias in all domains [22, 32, 36]. The results
for each included SRs are illustrated in Table 2. We
rated the overall risk of bias for eight SRs as low and for
13 SRs as high.

evidence for a positive impact of education on adherence
was exclusively noted for cardiovascular conditions [23,
37]. The impact of employment was mostly uncertain.
Some evidence for a positive impact was exclusively
noted in HIV-infected patients [32, 34]. The other conditions that were investigated for this influencing factor
(hepatitis C, inflammatory arthritis and cardiovascular

conditions) showed inconsistent results and thus were
judged as uncertain evidence [23, 27, 38]. For the analysis
of the influence of ethnic status on adherence, we considered different comparisons because the grouping in primary studies differed widely. Some evidence exist for
inflammatory arthritis and robust evidence for cardiovascular conditions (in the USA) that white ethnicity is

Gast and Mathes Systematic Reviews

(2019) 8:112

associated with higher adherence [33, 38]. In HIV-infected
patients, there was some evidence that white individuals
are more adherent than black individuals [32]. The SRs of
cardiovascular conditions showed some evidence that
large ethnic groups are more adherent than ethnic minorities [37]. Among patients with chronic diseases and patients taking oral anticancer agents, there was some
evidence that a better financial status has a positive influence on adherence [20, 39]. The impact of financial status
was uncertain in Parkinson disease, hepatitis C and cardiovascular conditions [21, 23, 27, 36, 37]. The influence
of the socioeconomic status was uncertain in inflammatory arthritis and patients taking oral anticancer agents
[28, 38]. In cardiovascular conditions, some evidence exists that a higher socioeconomic status has a positive impact on adherence [29]. Marital status was investigated in
the SRs on Parkinson disease, inflammatory arthritis,
chronic diseases, HIV, patients taking oral anticancer
agents and cardiovascular conditions. The results were
very inconsistent, and consequently, the impact was
judged as uncertain overall [20, 23, 32, 36, 38, 39]. In
addition, the impact of social support was uncertain in all
SRs [23, 28, 30, 37, 38].
Therapy-related factors

We found some evidence for a negative influence of intake of different medications in cardiovascular conditions. The impact of all other therapy related factors
(duration of therapy, number of tablets, intake frequency, intake at meals) was uncertain in all conditions
[23, 28, 35–39].
Disease-related factors

Duration of disease was the only disease-related factor
considered in this overview. Most of the SRs that analysed
this factor showed conflicting effect directions, and the
evidence for an impact was thus judged as either uncertain or probably no impact overall [23, 27, 28, 35, 38, 39].
Patient-related factors

In six of eight conditions, positive effect directions for
higher age were reported. In two conditions (cardiovascular conditions and Parkinson disease), some evidence of an
impact was found, and the impact of the other four conditions/medications was uncertain [20, 23, 24, 28, 35–39]. In
contrast, negative effect directions of higher age in chronic
diseases, cardiovascular conditions and oral anticancer
agents were reported [20, 21, 23, 24, 28, 39]. However, the
evidence for an impact was uncertain. More distinct (no
linear) age groups were compared in the SRs on adherence
in inflammatory arthritis, chronic diseases, HIV-infected
patients, patients taking oral anticancer agents and cardiovascular conditions [20, 21, 23, 28, 31, 32, 37–39]. In two

Page 14 of 17

conditions, there was some evidence for an impact. In
HIV-infected patients, persons older than 45 years tend to
be more adherent than those under 45 years [32]. In patients taking oral anticancer agents, there was some evidence that middle-aged people (approximately 45–60) are
more adherent than very old (> 75 years) and younger
people (< 45 years) [28]. General comorbidity or physical
comorbidity was assessed in inflammatory arthritis [38],
patients taking oral anticancer agents, hepatitis C, chronic
diseases and cardiovascular conditions [20, 21, 27, 28, 37,
39]. Overall, positive as well as negative effect directions
were reported in all included SRs, and the evidence was
therefore judged to be uncertain. General mental comorbidity was considered a potential adherence-influencing
factor in the conditions Parkinson disease, hepatitis C,
chronic diseases and cardiovascular conditions. Negative
effect directions were reported for most conditions, while
the results were inconsistent in hepatitis C and cardiovascular conditions [20, 21, 27, 30, 36, 37]. The evidence for
an impact was mostly judged as uncertain for this factor.
Some evidence for a negative impact of mental comorbidity on medication adherence was exclusively noted in hepatitis C and cardiovascular conditions [21, 27, 30, 37].
Depression was analysed in patients taking oral anticancer
agents, HIV infection or cardiovascular conditions. In patients taking oral anticancer agents and HIV-infected patients, some evidence was observed, and robust evidence
for a negative impact was noted in cardiovascular conditions [28, 30, 32]. Gender was analysed in the SRs on
chronic pain, hepatitis C, inflammatory arthritis, chronic
diseases, oral anticancer agents and cardiovascular conditions [20, 21, 23, 27, 28, 33, 35, 37–39]. The impact was
judged as uncertain in all SRs because the effect directions
were conflicting (within and between SRs). Some evidence
for higher adherence in women was noted exclusively in
cardiovascular conditions [21, 23, 33, 37].
Health care system-related factors

For co-payments (any co-payment and higher co-payments),
the effect direction was almost always negative. Some evidence for a negative impact of co-payments on adherence
in inflammatory arthritis, chronic diseases and cardiovascular conditions exists [20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 38]. The
meta-analysis of Sinnott et al. provides robust evidence for
a negative impact of co-payments on adherence across different conditions [40]. The evidence for an impact was
uncertain in oral-anticancer agents [39]. In cardiovascular
conditions, there was some evidence that patients not paying any co-payments are more adherent than those patients paying (any) co-payments [25, 26]. Medication costs
were analysed in patients with inflammatory arthritis and
patients taking oral anticancer agents. Only negative effect
directions were reported, but the evidence for a negative
impact on adherence was uncertain in both conditions

Gast and Mathes Systematic Reviews

(2019) 8:112

[38, 39]. It was uncertain whether health insurance status
(insured vs. uninsured) influences adherence in patients
with chronic or cardiovascular conditions [23, 25].

Discussion
This overview includes 21 SRs on 313 individual primary
studies in a broad spectrum of chronic conditions. Compared with the previous version, this focused update increases the certainty of evidence for some factors (e.g.,
co-payments or ethnic status) and identifies new evidence on other factors (socioeconomic status, depression
and insurance status) [12].
We analysed seven potentially socioeconomic adherenceinfluencing factors. Although mostly positive effect directions were reported, the overall evidence for an impact is
uncertain for employment and education. The evidence
synthesis indicates that belonging to an ethnic minority
seems to be associated with reduced adherence. In contrast, higher financial status and better socioeconomic
position seem to have a positive impact on adherence.
None of the therapy-related (but not therapy-specific) factors showed evidence for a strong impact on adherence.
The same seems to be true for disease duration. Studies
focusing on distinct age groups suggest that age does not
have a linear association with adherence but that the association is rather a concave shape with an adherence peak
in middle to older ages, i.e., adherence is particularly low
in very young and very old persons. Studies that analysed
age as a continuous linear variable and studies that dichotomized age showed inconsistent results. The explanation
for the inconsistent results of the linear analyses might
also be attributed to the fact that the association is indeed
non-linear. Gender seems to have no consistent impact on
adherence. Considering comorbidities, there was only robust evidence that depression impacts adherence negatively. We also found robust evidence that co-payments
reduce adherence. Considering this information together
with the socioeconomic factors and age suggests that
there is a social gradient in adherence behaviour.
Although the majority of literature on adherence-influencing factors is overwhelming, we could only judge the
influence for many factors as uncertain. In addition,
from the high risk of bias, the main reason for so many
uncertain judgements was imprecision. The main cause
for downgrading due to imprecision was insufficient
reporting, which prevented us from adequately assessing
the results. For example, in many cases, we could not
even use modified vote counting satisfactorily. Therefore, unclear impact ratings indicate that the evidence is
insufficient to allow a conclusion not that there is the
tendency that these factors have no impact.
Moreover, the results for many factors were inconsistent. Overviews of SRs are always at high risk for discordant or heterogeneous results across the included SRs

Page 15 of 17

[42]. We tried to prevent strong heterogeneity by focusing on factors for which we assumed homogeneity across
different conditions and considering only implementation adherence to oral drugs. Nevertheless, the results of
our overview were also partly heterogeneous. This is
particularly true for the influencing factors education,
employment, different medications, duration of disease
and gender. One might argue that this suggests that the
influence of these factors dependents on condition or
setting. However, if inconsistency was observed, this was
mostly true within as well as between SRs. Thus, we believe that positive findings might be caused by spurious
findings in primary studies (confounding bias, type one
error rate, selective reporting). A condition-related explanation for heterogeneity might be that many SRs
seem to include symptomatic as well as asymptomatic
patients. Research has shown that symptomatic patients
are mostly more adherent than asymptomatic patients
[43, 44]. This assumption is supported by the fact that
especially therapy- and disease-related influencing factors, which are related to the symptomatic patients, were
inconsistent. Moreover, none of the included SRs distinguishes intentional (conscious decision not to take medication) and unintentional adherence (forget to take
medication); however, it strongly stands to reason that
the influencing factors can depend on the underlying
reasons for non-adherence [45]. Additional sources of
inconsistency that we could not control for were different definitions and measurements of influencing factors
(e.g., socioeconomic status) and even more adherence measures (e.g., self-reported vs. electronic monitoring, > 90% of
pills taken vs. > 80% vs. mean intake).
We included SRs on any physical chronic diseases and
analysed only factors we assumed were independent of
disease/therapy. Therefore, on the one hand, we believe
that our results are widely applicable for implementation
adherence to oral drugs in physical chronic diseases. On
the other hand, it should be considered in the interpretation of the findings that the influence of a factor might
vary between region/setting. In particular, the influence
of different ethnic groups probably depends on the
country/region since an ethnic minority in one region
could be an ethnic majority in another region However,
although ethnic minorities are different ethnic groups in
different countries, we believe that all ethnic minorities
likely face similar adherence challenges independent of
the country they live in.
The identified risk factors of non-adherence can indicate
patients who are at increased risk for non-adherence. For
clinical practice, this information can help identify and select patients who require support for being adherent. In
studies on adherence, the information can help with the
identification of relevant participants [46] or the development of adherence risk prediction models [47]. Moreover,

Gast and Mathes Systematic Reviews

(2019) 8:112

the knowledge of influencing factors of adherence can
support the development of tailored health technologies
to increase adherence by treating the underlying barriers
(e.g., depression treatment, reducing co-payments). In this
regard, health policy decision makers should consider that
there seems to be a social gradient in adherence.
Our overview has some methodological limitations. First,
we limited our literature search to English and German
languages because there were no other language skills in
our research team and no resources for translating articles.
Second, we used modified vote counting; however, we are
aware that this type of methodology has strong limitations.
Nevertheless, we decided to use modified vote counting
because we anticipated that this is the only method to
harmonize the results from different types of narrative synthesizes. Third, we only analysed therapy-unrelated factors.
Consequently, regarding indications where therapy-related
factors play an important role (e.g., adverse events in
chemotherapy), our evidence is incomplete per se.

Conclusion
There is sufficient evidence that depression and co-payments have a negative impact on adherence. Evidence suggests that general mental comorbidity and belonging to an
ethnic minority might have a negative impact on adherence and that a higher socioeconomic status might have a
positive impact on adherence. In addition, the evidence
suggests that the influence of age on medication adherence has a concave pattern, i.e., lower adherence in young
age groups, increasing adherence with a peak in middle to
older age groups and lower adherence in very old age
groups. The moderate to high risk of bias in the included
SRs and the exclusion of 78 reviews due to missing quality
assessment of included primary studies indicate that there
is a need for more methodically sound research to provide
stronger conclusions. Future primary studies and SRs
should use validated adherence measures, adjust the analysis for relevant confounding factors, avoid using arbitrary cut-offs for influencing factors (e.g., age) and report
the effect measures with 95% confidence intervals. Furthermore, the studies should analyse intentional and
non-intentional adherence distinctly.
