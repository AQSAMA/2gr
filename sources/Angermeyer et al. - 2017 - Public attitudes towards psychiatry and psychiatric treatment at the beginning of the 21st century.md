Public attitudes towards psychiatry are crucial determinants of help-seeking for mental illness. It has been argued that psychiatry as a discipline enjoys low esteem among the public, and a “crisis” of psychiatry has been noted. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
population studies examining public attitudes towards various aspects of psychiatric care. Our search in PubMed, Web of Science, PsychINFO
and bibliographies yielded 162 papers based on population surveys conducted since 2000 and published no later than 2015. We found that
professional help for mental disorders generally enjoys high esteem. While general practitioners are the preferred source of help for depression,
mental health professionals are the most trusted helpers for schizophrenia. If respondents have to rank sources of help, they tend to favor mental health professionals, while open questions yield results more favorable to general practitioners. Psychiatrists and psychologists/psychotherapists are equally recommended for the treatment of schizophrenia, while for depression psychologists/psychotherapists are more recommended,
at least in Europe and America. Psychotherapy is consistently preferred over medication. Attitudes towards seeking help from psychiatrists or
psychologists/psychotherapists as well as towards medication and psychotherapy have markedly improved over the last twenty-five years. Biological concepts of mental illness are associated with stronger approval of psychiatric help, particularly medication. Self-stigma and negative attitudes towards persons with mental illness decrease the likelihood of personally considering psychiatric help. In conclusion, the public readily
recommends psychiatric help for the treatment of mental disorders. Psychotherapy is the most popular method of psychiatric treatment. A useful
strategy to further improve the public image of psychiatry could be to stress that listening and understanding are at the core of psychiatric care.

In recent years, the notion of a crisis of psychiatry has
spread in professional circles. In scientific journals, the question has been asked whether psychiatry is “on the ropes”1 and
“psychiatrists are an endangered species”2. Numerous internal
threats to psychiatry (e.g., feeling of loss of autonomy, competing views which highlight biological or social factors, or tension
between generalists and specialists) as well as external threats
(e.g., changes related to health care and medical education policies, intrusion of other health professional groups into the territory which psychiatry claims for itself) have been identified1,2.
There is also growing concern about the poor image of the
discipline in the eyes of the general public as well as of medical
students, health professionals and the media3,4. Psychiatrists
increasingly feel underestimated as well as stigmatized and discriminated against5. In a recent online survey across twelve
countries around the globe, psychiatrists reported significantly
higher perceived stigma and discrimination experiences than
general practitioners. About 17% of the psychiatrists perceived
stigma as a serious problem, with a higher rate among younger
participants6. In response to this problem, the World Psychiatric
Association established a task force and entrusted it with the
development of a “guidance on how to combat stigmatization
of psychiatry and psychiatrists”7. A few years later, the European Psychiatric Association followed with the publication of a
“guidance on improving the image of psychiatry and of the
psychiatrist”5.
The question arises as to whether this negative image perceived by the profession actually reflects attitudes towards

50

psychiatry that are prevalent among the general public. Therefore we decided to investigate, based on a systematic review
and meta-analysis of pertinent studies, to what extent psychiatric care is accepted (or rejected) by the public. More specifically, we wanted to explore to what extent the public sees
seeking help from a psychiatrist (in comparison to the help
provided by a psychologist/psychotherapist or a general practitioner) as useful and does recommend it, or instead considers
it as harmful and advices against it. We were also interested in
attitudes towards various psychiatric treatments, with special
focus on psychotropic medication and psychotherapy. In addition, we wanted to examine how attitudes towards psychiatric
treatments are influenced by mental health literacy and stigmatizing attitudes. Since attitudes do not necessarily remain stable
over time, we focused on the current situation, including only
studies conducted since the turn of the century, but also considered time-trend studies exploring how attitudes have developed over the last decades.

METHODS

Systematic review
We first systematically reviewed all papers reporting results
of representative population-based studies on beliefs and attitudes about mental disorders published in peer-reviewed journals between January 2000 and December 2015. To search for

World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017

relevant papers, we took a stepwise approach according to the
systematic literature review guidelines of the Centre for Reviews
and Dissemination8 and the Cochrane Collaboration9. As a starting point, we conducted a literature search in PubMed, Web of
Science and PsychINFO using the terms: (population OR representative) AND (depression OR schizophrenia OR “mental disorder” OR alcohol OR “substance abuse” OR “bipolar disorder” OR
“obsessive compulsive disorder” OR suicide OR “anxiety disorder” OR “dementia” OR “eating disorder” OR “attention deficit
hyperactive disorder” OR “post-traumatic stress disorder”) AND
(knowledge OR attitude OR stigma OR stereotype OR discrimination OR “mental health literacy”). We used MeSH terms and
truncations according to the properties of each database. We
included all papers written in any of the European languages.
Our search on May 25, 2016 resulted in 4,399 articles from
PubMed, 8,912 articles from PsycINFO, and 14,033 articles
from Web of Science. After manually removing all duplicates,
this resulted in 12,424 references. Two independent researchers screened titles, abstracts and (where appropriate) the full
text of all identified papers. All reports on studies meeting the
following inclusion criteria were retained: a) the focus of the
study was on the general public (studies investigating beliefs
and attitudes of particular subgroups such as consumers, health

World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017

professionals or students were excluded); b) samples were
obtained by either random or quota sampling methods; c) while
we included studies focusing on attitudes about substancerelated disorders, those merely dealing with attitudes toward
substance use and not referring to any disorder were excluded.
After exclusion of papers not meeting those criteria, we
ended up with 423 papers. We then hand-searched the identified literature for relevant citations and searched electronically
for other relevant publications by authors of papers thus far
identified. By this method we identified 222 further papers
that met our inclusion criteria. Our search strategy then
yielded in total 645 papers (see Figure 1), 65 of which (10.1%)
were written in languages other than English.
A full-text analysis of all these papers was carried out independently by two researchers. Only papers reporting results
from population surveys conducted since the turn of the century were included in the review. We excluded studies investigating attitudes prevalent among youth or attitudes towards
mentally ill youth. Studies on help-seeking from mental health
professionals in general without specification of psychiatrists
were also excluded. The following data were extracted from
each paper: a) attitudes towards seeking help from a psychiatrist (as compared to a psychologist/psychotherapist or a gen-

eral practitioner); b) attitudes towards psychiatric treatments,
particularly psychotropic medication and psychotherapy; c)
evolution of attitudes over time; d) association of these attitudes with mental health literacy and stigma.
In total, 162 papers containing relevant information could
be identified10-171. If necessary, native speakers were contacted
to provide translations. Disagreement about inclusion of individual papers into the review or about the allocation to the
various analytic categories was resolved by discussion.

Meta-analysis
Three main methodological approaches can be distinguished when evaluating attitudes towards psychiatric treatment:
a) rating of different sources of help (respondents are usually
presented with a case vignette or an illness label, and offered a
list of possible help-seeking strategies; they are then asked to
indicate for each source of help how likely they would recommend it for the problem described); b) ranking of these sources of help (first choice, second choice, etc.); c) open-ended
questions (asking for unprompted recommendation or helpseeking intentions). We chose the largest group of methodologically similar papers: those eliciting help-seeking attitudes
via rating of different sources or methods of treatment for
either depression or schizophrenia.
We distinguished three sources of professional help: general
practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists/psychotherapists.
The term “psychotherapist” has slightly different meanings in
the various countries of the world, being applied to people with
different professional training and affiliation. In this review, the

52

term is used in the sense of “provider of psychotherapy”. We
grouped psychotherapists and psychologists together as the latter also offer primarily psychotherapy, and contrast them with
psychiatrists, who offer pharmacotherapy and, to a varying
degree, psychotherapy.
To account for cultural differences, we performed separate
meta-analyses for different geographical regions, and then
combined these into an overall meta-analysis. Because we
were interested not only in the absolute proportion of respondents recommending different treatment modalities, but also
in their relative importance compared to other sources of help,
we included only those studies that simultaneously examined
recommendations of either psychiatrist, psychologist/psychotherapist and general practitioner as sources of help, or medication and psychotherapy as treatment methods for depression or
schizophrenia.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/MP software, release 13.1172. Meta-analyses of treatment recommendations were performed using the metaprop package173. An inverse
variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed
using score test-based confidence intervals on the proportions
of recommendation for general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist/psychotherapist, medication and psychotherapy in
schizophrenia and depression respectively. In all meta-analyses,
the I2 statistic indicated no significant heterogeneity between
studies (I250.0%).
In contrast to common meta-analysis, a meta-regression
focuses on the annual change of the treatment and help-seeking
recommendation (rather than on the overall recommendation).
Therefore, only studies reporting results for at least two time

points were chosen. Each time point of each study was taken as
one observation with its independent proportion of respondents
endorsing a specific recommendation in one survey. To estimate
the overall recommendation change per year, we used the
revised version of the metareg command174, which performs a
random effect meta-regression analysis using aggregated-level
data. For each recommendation (general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist/psychotherapist, medication and psychotherapy for schizophrenia and depression, respectively), change was
adjusted for country, allowing for differing country-specific
baselines for any recommendation change.
All reported p values are two sided. For our figures and
tables, proportions (values between 0 and 1) were transformed
into percent (0-100) to reflect the reported percentages in the
single studies.

RESULTS

Attitudes towards seeking help from a psychiatrist or
psychologist/psychotherapist
Figures 2 and 3 show the results of meta-analyses of studies
eliciting recommendations of different health professionals for
depression and schizophrenia. Overall, the proportion of
respondents recommending professional help was high (68 to
85%). For depression, general practitioners were recommended by 81%, followed by psychologists/psychotherapists
(76%) and psychiatrists (70%). For schizophrenia, psychologists/psychotherapists were recommended by 85% and psychiatrists by 83%, followed by general practitioners with 68%.
In all regions, specialist mental health care was more frequently recommended for schizophrenia than for depression. Looking

World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017

at differences between continents, it appears that general practitioners are less popular in Asia (being recommended by a subtotal
of 27% and 35% for treating schizophrenia and depression).
A number of studies enquired recommendation of a general
practitioner, psychiatrist and “other mental health worker”,
most notably the Stigma in Global Context – Mental Health
Study142, which itself comprised surveys in 16 countries, and
the Mental Health Module of the US General Social Survey65.
These studies used four-point Likert scales to elicit recommendations without a neutral midpoint, resulting in generally
higher rates of recommendations. We performed a separate
meta-analysis of these studies. Here, psychiatrists were recommended more often than “other mental health workers” for
treating both schizophrenia (95% vs. 93%) and depression
(91% vs. 87%). For both disorders, general practitioners were
recommended by 92%, which again positioned them above
mental health specialists for depression, and below them for
treating schizophrenia.
When asked to rank different sources of help, respondents
tended to prefer specialist care over general medical care. For
schizophrenia, psychiatrists and psychologists/psychotherapists
were consistently named more frequently as first choice than
general practitioners40,80,148. For depression, studies from
Germany40, Australia18, Hong Kong111, Jordan125, Pakistan41 and
China148 found psychiatrists and psychologists/psychotherapists
as popular or even more popular for treating this disorder compared to general practitioners. When comparing the ranking of
psychologists/psychotherapists and psychiatrists, 6 out of 9
studies found the former being preferred over the latter41,80,103,139,148,163, only one study found the opposite125, and
two studies found no difference18,40.
When using open ended questions, general medical care was
mentioned more often than specialist care. Studies from Germany,

Belgium, Sweden and Australia found general practitioners
being named more frequently than psychiatrists or psychologists/psychotherapists for treating both depression and
schizophrenia44,47,56,141. Only a study from Japan found psychiatrists mentioned more frequently than a general practitioner for both depression and schizophrenia38.

Attitudes towards psychiatric medication and
psychotherapy
Figures 4 and 5 show forest plots for psychiatric treatments,
namely psychotherapy and medication. Again, only studies eliciting both treatment modalities for either schizophrenia or
depression are included, to enable a direct comparison of the
subtotal and overall recommendation rates within one disorder.
Medication was recommended by 49% for depression and 67%
for schizophrenia. Psychotherapy was clearly more popular,
being recommended by 76% for depression and 85% for schizophrenia. The general preference for psychotherapy was thus
even more marked for schizophrenia than for depression. Only
studies from Canada52,109,119 found medication being slightly
more popular than psychotherapy for treating depression.
Using a ranking approach, a similar picture emerged for
both depression and schizophrenia: psychotherapy was more
frequently than medication named as first choice30,40,80,103.

Attitudes towards psychiatric inpatient care
Few studies examined attitudes towards psychiatric inpatient care. Generally, inpatient care was more accepted for
schizophrenia than for depression or other mental disorders,
that were perceived as less severe38,80,92. For example, in the
US, inpatient care was recommended by 66% for a person
with schizophrenia and by 27% for a person with depression92.
Findings on whether psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric
wards at general hospitals are preferred were inconsistent, with
some studies showing a preference for specialized hospitals,
particularly for patients with schizophrenia80, others showing
preferences for general hospitals67, and still others demonstrat-

World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017

ing similar attitudes towards both forms of psychiatric inpatient
care146.

Evolution of attitudes towards psychiatrists and
psychiatric treatments
Table 1 shows the results of our meta-regression analyses
of time trends in recommending different sources of help.
Trend data from vignette-based studies were available from
Germany, Australia and the US65,71,74,109,129. All analyses showed
a significant increase in treatment recommendations over
time for medication and psychotherapy as well as for general
practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists/psychotherapists.
The strongest increase in recommendations was visible for
medication, increasing by 1.10% per year for depression (95%
CI: 0.38-1.83) and 1.45% per year for schizophrenia (95% CI:
0.78-2.12).
Other studies specifically examined the evolution of attitudes towards psychiatric medication without using a case
vignette. In the US, attitudes towards psychotropic medication
generally became more favorable between 1998 and 200678. A
study from Germany, covering the time period 1990-2001,
showed a similar trend, with increasingly positive attitudes
towards medication24. The same holds for a study in a Swedish
community, where between 1976 and 2003 a marked improvement of attitudes towards medication was observed59.
A trend analysis of attitudes towards psychotherapy in
Germany showed growing positive outcome expectations and
a decline in negative evaluations between 2003 and 2012 also
for this treatment modality126.
Approval of restrictions for persons with mental illness –
such as compulsory admission in Germany149 and involuntary
medication in the US106 – remained largely stable over the last
years, with three out of four respondents endorsing compulsory admission and one in four endorsing involuntary medication. However, closer examination of accepted reasons for
compulsory admission showed a remarkable lowering of
thresholds for admitting persons with mental illness in those
who generally approved of compulsory admission. For example, while 29% recommended compulsory admission if a per-

Mental health literacy and attitudes towards seeking help
from a psychiatrist and psychiatric treatments
Studies conducted in Germany, Belgium, Slovak Republic,
Russia and Japan examined the relationship between identifying
symptoms of schizophrenia or depression and help-seeking attitudes. Across all studies, recognition of a mental disorder or correct identification of the specific diagnosis was accompanied by
a greater willingness to recommend visiting a psychiatrist31,40,71,141 or higher expectations for the effectiveness of the
treatment offered by a psychiatrist121. With one exception, in all
Western countries participating in the Stigma in Global Context –
Mental Health Study, the lay diagnosis of schizophrenic symptoms as “mental illness” increased the likelihood that seeking
psychiatric help was considered important107.
The picture concerning attitudes towards psychiatric treatments was rather mixed. In Germany, Slovak Republic and
Russia, seeing symptoms of schizophrenia or depression as
indicating mental illness was associated with recommending
psychotherapy but not with recommending psychotropic medication31,40,71. Similarly, in Belgium and Turkey, recognition of
mental illness increased the likelihood that psychotherapy was
seen more favorably66,166. By contrast, in Japan, the lay diagnosis of depression was significantly associated with a high expectation of the effectiveness of antidepressants121, and in Australia
accurate recognition of depression or schizophrenia was associated with a stronger belief in helpfulness of antidepressants or
antipsychotics, respectively109,119.
In Germany, Slovak Republic and Russia, the attribution of
mental disorder to biogenetic causes was associated to recommending a psychiatrist31,40,71. In the US, a neurobiological
conceptualization of mental illness, i.e., attributing its cause to
either chemical imbalance or a genetic problem, tended to
increase the odds of endorsing help from a psychiatrist92. Only
in Belgium no such relationship was observed141.
Across all studies, attributing mental illness to biogenetic
causes31,40,71,120,143, holding a neurobiological conceptualization92 or endorsing a biomedical illness representation model100 were associated with more favorable attitudes towards
psychotropic medication. As regards attitudes towards psychotherapy, results were less consistent: in two studies endorsement of brain disease was associated with lower readiness to
recommend psychotherapy for the treatment of depression,

56

but not schizophrenia31; in one study it was associated with
even stronger recommendation of psychotherapy for the treatment of both disorders40.

Stigma and attitudes towards seeking help from a
psychiatrist and psychiatric treatments
Among the different stigma components, self-stigma – i.e.,
negative attitudes about oneself as a result of internalizing
stigmatizing ideas held by society – seems of particular importance for attitudes towards seeking help from a psychiatrist. In
a study in Australia, 44% of respondents reported they would
feel embarrassed to see a psychiatrist, and there was a significant negative association between self-stigma and help-seeking42. Similarly, in studies from the Netherlands and Belgium,
self-stigma was negatively related to the intention to seek help
from a psychiatrist155,158.
In addition, anticipated shame tends to decrease the likelihood of endorsing a psychiatrist as source of help81,158. Not
only the application of negative stereotypes to oneself, but
also negative attitudes towards other people with mental illness seem to play a role, as shown in a study from Germany,
where greater desire for social distance was associated with
weaker intentions to see a psychiatrist81.
In contrast to self-stigma, perceived stigma – i.e., the awareness of negative stereotypes held by the general public about
people receiving psychiatric help – and the anticipation of discrimination seem to have less impact on help-seeking. Only in
an Australian study42 perceived stigma had a negative effect,
while in Germany81, Belgium155, the Netherlands and Flanders158
no association with help-seeking was observed.
The relationship between stigma and attitudes towards medication did not show a consistent pattern. In Germany, Slovak
Republic and Russia, endorsing lack of will power as cause of
schizophrenia or depression had no effect on the recommendation of psychotropic medication. The same applied to the treatment of depression, with the exception of Slovak Republic,
where lack of will power was related to greater reluctance to recommend drugs31,40. In Flanders and the Netherlands, self-stigma
and perceived stigma were unrelated to the willingness to take
medication158. In a study from the US, perceived stigma had also
no impact on the preference for medication only100.
Only three studies examined the association between stigma and attitudes towards psychotherapy. In one study the
endorsement of lack of will power as cause of schizophrenia or
depression was related to less readiness to recommend psychotherapy40; in the other two studies no such relationship
was observed31.

DISCUSSION
Some limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. First, our systematic review focused on depression and
schizophrenia, as we were unable to identify sufficient num-

son did not take prescribed medication in 1993, this proportion rose to 40% in 2011149.
The image of the psychiatric hospital improved considerably between 1990 and 2011 in Germany130. Both in the US
and Australia, the proportion recommending hospital care for
schizophrenia or depression increased in recent years65,92,119.
In contrast, approval of community services, such as group
homes in one’s neighborhood, decreased between 1990 and
2011 in Germany, with 35% welcoming such a service in their
neighborhood in 1990, compared to 24% in 2011128, while it
remained stable in the UK135.

US, for instance, from 1998 to 2007, there was a significant
increase in the percentage of outpatients who received pharmacotherapy alone to treat their mental disorder, which was
mirrored by a significant decline in the use of psychotherapy
alone as well as psychotherapy in combination with pharmacotherapy. By 2007, over half of outpatients, regardless of their
mental health condition, received only pharmacotherapy178.
The general public prefers psychotherapy not only for treating depression but also for treating schizophrenia, which
might seem counterintuitive and conflicting with professional
treatment recommendations. A possible explanation for this
rather surprising result may be that the term “psychotherapy”
does not necessarily mean the same for lay people as it does
for mental health professionals. In a study from Austria,
respondents who had endorsed psychotherapy were asked
what kind of psychotherapy they had in mind. Two thirds of
them mentioned “talk therapy” or simply “talking”, and only a
tiny minority named established forms of psychotherapy like
cognitive behavioral or psychodynamic psychotherapy179.
This indifference to the specific forms of psychotherapy
might indicate that, instead of being treated by means of a certain technique, people have the (quite legitimate) need to be
listened to by someone who takes them seriously and who is
trying to understand them with their problem. Accordingly,
the reason why psychologists/psychotherapists are in some
instances preferred over psychiatrists could be that, in the
eyes of the public, psychologists and psychotherapists are
more ready to provide patients with an opportunity to talk
over their problems89,176. As M. Maj180 has recently pointed
out, the role of empathetic communication in psychiatry has
been underestimated in the past few decades, “ignoring the
fact that without communicative interaction no person will
allow any professional to genuinely access his/her personal
world”. A good strategy to improve the public image of psychiatry would thus be to point out that, of course, personal interaction, talking and empathetic understanding are at the core
of psychiatric care, and not just prescribing medication.
Although we found no indication that psychiatry as a medical discipline is stigmatized, stigma is still a relevant problem
for help-seeking. Similar to a recent extensive review of stigma
and help-seeking181, the studies included in our analyses point
out that particularly self-stigma and individual stigmatizing
attitudes are a prominent barrier to seeking help. It is our contention that, rather than seeing themselves as victims and
spending their scarce resources on combating the stigma
allegedly attached to their profession, psychiatrists would be
better advised to fully engage in the fight against the stigma
attached to those suffering from mental illness182.

bers of research reports focusing on other mental disorders.
Second, our review only included papers written in English or
other European languages, which may have resulted in an
underrepresentation of countries where other languages are
used for disseminating research results. Third, in order to
ensure a minimum quality of selected studies, we only included peer-reviewed papers and excluded grey literature, online
research reports and doctoral theses. Having said that, our
review comprises the largest body of population studies on
attitudes towards help-seeking so far analyzed, and our metaanalyses allow identification of both different and similar patterns of attitudes across the world.
From a global perspective, our results suggest that the help
provided by psychiatrists is held in high esteem by the public,
being recommended by over 80 percent of respondents for the
treatment of schizophrenia and by 70 percent for the treatment of depression. In the sixteen countries participating in
the Stigma in Global Context – Mental Health Study, the proportion of those opting for psychiatric treatment in case of
schizophrenia or depression amounted even to over 90 percent. Psychiatrists are slightly preferred over general practitioners for the treatment of schizophrenia, while the opposite
holds for the treatment of depression. The public’s readiness
to recommend seeking help from a psychiatrist has increased
over the past 25 years. Thus, our findings do not support the
notion that psychiatry is currently exposed to strong discrimination and, as a consequence, shunned by the public. The gap
between the attitudes of the public and those perceived by
psychiatrists could be seen as an indication of psychiatrists’
inclination to self-stigmatization175, which, in the end, may
result in low morale and a sense of entrapment1.
However, this rather optimistic appraisal needs some qualification when comparing attitudes towards psychiatrists with
those towards psychologists/psychotherapists. These groups
of professionals work closely together and, with doctors working as psychotherapists in several countries, the line between
them is not always clear cut. However, in some instances the
public seems to prefer one group over the other. Psychologists/psychotherapists are more recommended than psychiatrists for the treatment of depression, at least in Europe
and America. According to our meta-analysis, psychologists/
psychotherapists are recommended as much as psychiatrists
even for the treatment of schizophrenia – a disorder which is
at the heart of psychiatry. This high standing of psychologists/
psychotherapists seems to mirror the fact that, as our metaanalysis has shown, psychotherapy is the favorite treatment
method among the general public, while pharmacotherapy,
which is considered to be the main treatment offered by psychiatrists89,176, is less appreciated. Although medication has
gained popularity in recent years, there remains a large gap in
public acceptance between the two treatment options.
The public’s preference for psychotherapy is in sharp contrast to real-world clinical practice in many countries, where
pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment for most mental
disorders and psychotherapy is rather on the decline177. In the
