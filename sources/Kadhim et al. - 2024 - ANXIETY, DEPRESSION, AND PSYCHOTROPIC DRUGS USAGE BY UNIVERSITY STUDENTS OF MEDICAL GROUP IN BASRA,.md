Background: Psychological disease is strongly prevalent among college and
university students worldwide with negative impacts on students’ life. Specifically,
medical group students have long time of study with suffer from competitive
ambience and sleep privation, that lead to out of the way from perfect learning
environment. When medical students are abused psychotropic drugs that lead to
defect on performance, health, life style and interpose with their concentration.
Aim: To investigate the prevalence rate of depression and anxiety in university
students of medical group in Basra, and estimate the rate and type of psychotropic
drugs consumption by them.
Method: The study data was collected from 376 students of medical group at
College of Medicine, College of Dentistry and College of Pharmacy of Basra
University by questionnaire forma.
Results: The prevalence rate of mental disorders was low about and many factors

INTRODUCTION
Psychological disease is an emotional distress with
symptoms include anxiety (like tenseness, stress),
depression (like sadness, loss of attention) and somatic
or functional symptoms (like loss of appetite,
headache, wakefulness, paucity of energy)1. The
prevalence of depression in worldwide is appeared by
World Health Organization (WHO) about 6% in
women and 4% in men. Where, the total numbers of
populations that suffering from depression elevated by
18.4% at 2005 to 2015. On the other hand, the
prevalence of anxiety which is the other most common
psychiatric disease about 5% in women and 3% in
men2. Psychotropic drugs are any drug that influence

uncontrolled and long-term that lead to addiction and
serious effects on their professionals’ performance and
health7,15. On other hand, Mental disorders with higher
risk in university students of medical group than other
university students because they have full of stress with
medical practice and hard circumstances like clinical

training stress, long term of study (reach 6 years),
financial burden etc. Medical group students required
more interest and alertness because mental disorders
are oversensitive in medical group students throughout
their clinical practice and life style16.

Regarding the kind of psychotropic drugs that are taken
(Figure 3), the most often used drugs were sedatives
and hypnotics (46.4%), serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) (42.9%) followed by
tricyclic antidepressants (21.4%), and atypical
antipsychotic (7.1%).

Among medical group students were afraid from their
future and was strong significant (p<0.05) affected on
the prevalence of mental disorders because students
had depressed and stress after college due to fail in
trial, overstate of responsibility and premonition from
practice attempt. Both Alsalameh et al., and Amiri R
studies were consistent with these results while,
Farooqui et al., study was inconsistent it16,18.
Fifty of psychotropic drugs used of medical group
students with sleep hours more than 8 hr per day and
there was inversely significant relation (p<0.05) and
this result was correspondence with Dong et al.,
study23. Also, among them were nonsmokers about
93% and non-significant relation with mental disorders.
Despite, half of psychotropic drugs used of medical
group students were drank (1-2) cup of coffee and
strong relation between them (p<0.05) because coffee
was contained the phenolic acids that could be cross
BBB and the cerebrospinal fluid where they could be
effect on brain health 24,25.
Most of psychotropic drugs used of medical group
students were take psychotropic drugs about 61% on
need and they take drugs under doctor physician
(82.1%) that lead to health status improved in among
them (67.9%). The recent study was appeared among
medical group students that used sedatives and
hypnotics about (46%) than other psychotropic drugs
like serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
(SNRIs) (42.9%) tricyclic antidepressants (21.4%), and
atypical antipsychotic (7.1%) because these drugs
(sedative and hypnotic) were more present and less
expensive. This result was inconsistent with Amiri and
Farooqui et al., studies that appeared SSRIs group was
most commonly used by medical students16,18.
Limitations of the study
We did not inquire of the students when they began
taking psychotropic drugs in the survey. As a result,
pinpointing the precise time (month and year) of
psychotropic drug use was impossible. Furthermore,
the type of anxiety or depression that the students in
the Medical Group were diagnosed with was not
mentioned, despite the fact that these conditions are
known to differ greatly from one another and require
different approaches to treatment. Despite the
anonymity of the questionnaire, some students might
not have been able to answer the survey honestly due
to the stigma associated with mental illness.

DISCUSSION
The development of community was depended on an
ambitious of university students; therefore, they should
be full active, healthy and positive interests. In this
study was concentrated on the prevalence of mental
disorders among medical group students and the factors
that affected on psychiatric state of them. Also, the
percent of psychotic drugs that used by university
students of medical groups. In recent study, the rate of
prevalence of mental disorders of medical group
students (medicine, dentistry and pharmacy) about
7.4% and among students were before graduation year
and this result was agreement by Alsalameh et al.,
study17. The percent of all students were similarly in
both age groups (≤20 years=43.9% and >20
years=56.1%), while the individuals that taken
psychotropic drug in >20 years age group (85.7%)
were more than ≤20 years age group (14.3%) and there
was significant relation between age and the mental
disorders rate (p<0.05) and this result agreement with
Farooqui et al., study18 and that mean age factor may
be affected on the prevalence of mental disorders that
associated with other items like clinical training stress,
study load, financial burden 16,19.
On other hand, Gender factor may be affected in the
prevalence of mental disorders. Of 376 individuals
(75% female and 25% male) and of medical group
students that taken psychotropic drugs (89.3% female
and 10.7% male). Alsalameh et al., and KovessMasfety et al., studies appeared the same results on
gender factor where female were more expressed
mental and depressive disorders than male and also
depended on severity and type of psychological
problem17,20. In the current study, there was significant
relation between year of study, Years of Failure and
place of college (in same or out Governorate) with the
rate of prevalence of mental disorders among medical
group students and this result disagreement by Amiri R
and Jadoon NA et al.,16,21. The family ordering of all
student in this study was middle about 50% and the
family ordering of among medical group students was
middle about 61% and it was not significant with the
rate of prevalence of mental disorders that meaning the
family ordering of student may be affected on social
situationdue to less interest and concern by parents of
students. On other hand, Marital Status of among
medical group students was single and it was
significantly (p<0.05) reducing the prevalence of
mental disorders. In the recent study, the students had
strong relation and significant with their friends and
family about 58% and 77% respectively. Also, they
were not loss one of parent about 87% therefore the
rate of prevalence of mental for students in this study
was very faint16,22.

ISSN: 2456-8058

CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of mental disorders may be increased
in general college students specifically medical group
college students because stress of study, study for long
time, more attention during practice life, financial
awkwardness, social relationships embarrassment.
Also, medical group students are more likely to
consumption antipsychotic drugs by physician
prescription or self-medications. Therefore, there are
required more interesting and pursuits for college
students especially medical college students for
amelioration their college and social lives.
