interventions

Abstract
Background: Resettled refugees are a particularly vulnerable group. They have very high levels of mental health
problems, in particular, trauma-related disorders, but very low uptake of mental health care. Evidence suggests that
poor “mental health literacy”, namely, poor knowledge and understanding of the nature and treatment of mental
health problems is a major factor in low or inappropriate treatment-seeking among individuals with mental health
problems. This study used a culturally adapted Mental Health Literacy Survey method to determine knowledge of,
and beliefs about, helpfulness of treatment interventions and providers for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
amongst resettled Iraqi refugees.
Methods: 225 resettled Iraqi refugees in Western Sydney attending the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP),
federally funded English language tuition, were surveyed. A vignette of a fictional character meeting diagnostic
criteria for PTSD was presented followed by the Mental Health Literacy Survey. PTSD symptomology was measured
using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire part IV (HTQ part IV), with Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) used to
measure levels of general psychological distress.
Results: Only 14.2% of participants labelled the problem as PTSD, with “a problem with fear” being the modal
response (41.8%). A total of 84.9% respondents indicated that seeing a psychiatrist would be helpful, followed by
reading the Koran or Bible selected by 79.2% of those surveyed. There was some variation in problem recognition and
helpfulness of treatment, most notably influenced by the length of resettlement in Australia of the respondents.
Conclusions: These findings have important implications for the design and implementation of mental health
promotion and treatment programs for resettled refugees and those who work with them.

Background
Refugee mental health refers to the specific psychological
health concerns of those who have been forcibly displaced
from their country of origin, due to circumstances defined
by the 1951 Refugee Convention [1]. Some 108, 000 refugees were resettled in Australia in the years between 2001
and 2010 [2], from a diverse range of nationalities and

cultural backgrounds. To be granted refugee status is to
have suffered persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion, or to have had
a genuine and justified fear of the same [1]. This persecution may include, and is not limited to, instances of torture [3], deprivation of necessities such as adequate food
and clean water and experiences of civil war [4]. Throughout this period, refugees are unlikely to have had
uninterrupted access to adequate primary healthcare
[5]. Following resettlement, refugees may experience
feelings of grief due to separation from their culture,

family and existing social supports, and language barriers can further contribute to feelings of isolation [6].
Consequently, refugees are a population particularly
vulnerable to disorders of both physical [7] and mental
health [8,9], even after resettlement.
A significant challenge in refugee mental health is willingness to access care. Importantly, resettled refugees
are significantly less likely than the general population to
utilise hospital services [10], despite a higher prevalence
of trauma related mental health disorders. Indeed, one
meta-analysis found that refugees resettled in Western
nations may be up to ten times more likely to suffer
from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than their
age matched controls in the general population [8]. Another systematic review reported weighted prevalence
rates across the surveys of 30.6 and 30.8% for PTSD and
depression, respectively [11]. In a Swiss study of migrants originating from Bosnia and Turkey, it was noted
that when medical attention is sought, somatic symptoms dominated the initial presentation. While psychological distress was revealed to be a more common
disturbance than somatic problems, this was only reported as a result of focused questioning [12]. A lack of
understanding of what constitutes mental illness may
present a barrier to accessing care, due in part to differences in cultural perceptions of mental health [13]. As
such, gaining an appreciation of an individual’s understanding of mental health can provide insight into their
willingness to access care for mental health concerns.
Mental health literacy (MHL) refers to, “knowledge
and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management or prevention” [14]. This encompasses (a) the ability to recognize specific disorders;
(b) knowledge of how to seek mental health information;
(c) knowledge of risk factors and causes, of self-treatments,
and of professional help available; and (d) attitudes that
promote recognition and appropriate help-seeking [14].
Increasing MHL can achieve dual goals. First, to empower
the public with an understanding of mental disorders,
thereby facilitating prevention, early intervention and treatment within the community [15]. Second, to empower
individuals with the means by which to make an informed
decision about accessing mental health care.
While multiple national surveys of MHL [16] have
ascertained the general attitudes of those living in
Australia, little is known about the mental health literacy
of resettled refugees. As a diverse, heterogeneous group,
originating from a range of cultures, nationalities and religions, studies of refugee health are best undertaken specific to a refugee subgroup. In Australia, Iraqi refugees are
one particularly prominent subgroup, with 4064 offshore
visas granted to Iraqi-born individuals in financial year
2012-2013 alone. This was the primary country of origin
for offshore visas in this time period, comprising 32.47%

Page 2 of 8

of the total visas granted [17]. Consequently, they are a
group of particular relevance to Australian health care
professionals, and are the population surveyed in this
study.
A recent study compared the mental health beliefs and
knowledge of Sydney-based Iraqi and Sudanese refugees
to those of their Australian-born counterparts [18]. Participants (n = 64) were given vignettes depicting characters with PTSD and major depressive disorder, for which
they were directed to identify a diagnosis and appropriate treatment approaches. Refugees of both Iraqi and
Sudanese origin demonstrated significantly lower use
of correct psychiatric labels, and a limited knowledge
of Western treatment approaches of mental disorders.
Although these findings suggest that resettled refugees
have low mental health literacy when judged against
the concepts of Western mental health professionals,
the generalizability of the findings was limited by the
use of vignettes written from a Western perspective,
the recruitment of participants from a treatment-seeking
sample, and the comparatively small sample size.
The goal of the current study was to add to this limited evidence base by examining the mental health literacy of resettled refugees in Australia. Specifically, this
study sought to determine knowledge of, and beliefs
about, helpfulness of treatment interventions and providers for PTSD amongst resettled Iraqi refugees resettled
in Australia. We sought to improve upon May et al’s [18]
study by recruiting a larger sample of participants from
the general population and by using a culturally adapted
mental health literacy survey methodology.

Methods
Study design and participants

All participants were resettled Iraqi refugees attending
the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) at several
different colleges in the Western Sydney region of
Australia. AMEP is a federally funded English language
tuition program that is offered to eligible migrants and
humanitarian entrants to Australia who do not have
functional English. Participation entailed the completion
of a pen-and-paper, respondent-based survey, conducted
on the college campuses by means of in-person interviews.
Bilingual investigators attended the colleges between
March and November 2013 and informed potential
participants of the project through the distribution of
flyers. The flyers outlined the aims and nature of the
research and indicated that all participants would receive a food gift voucher in the amount of AUD $25.00
upon completion of the survey in appreciation of their
time. Those interested were asked to notify their language
tutors, who would in turn, contact the investigators on
their behalf. Written consent was obtained from all participants, following a more detailed description of the survey

Slewa-Younan et al. BMC Psychiatry 2014, 14:320

content, prior to commencement of each interview. Inclusion criteria were having been born in Iraq, having left
Iraq no earlier than 1991, being fluent in Arabic and/or
English, and being between the ages of 18 and 70 years.
Approval for the study was obtained from the University
of Western Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee.
Interviews, administering the instruments described below,
in addition to the collection of demographic information,
were conducted by two bilingual (fluent in Arabic and
English) members of the research team and extended
up to 90 minutes. Additionally, all participants were
provided with translated information sheets containing
details of local specific mental health services available.
Measures
The Mental Health Literacy Survey

The survey was modelled on Jorm et al.’s [14] protocol,
with modifications by the authors (SSY, JM, YM and
AFJ) for the study of PTSD in refugees. Specifically, the
vignette was developed based on the consensus of several authors (SSY and YM) experienced in the assessment and clinical treatment of PTSD in Iraqi refugees.
Care was taken to ensure the vignette was culturally
valid and the final survey was translated into Arabic and
independently back-translated into English, using the
services of nationally accredited translation and interpreting service. All discrepancies were checked and
rectified by the translators, and the research team [19].
The vignette describing a fictional Iraqi refugee “Miriam
or Dawood” (sex of vignette character was matched to sex
of participant being interviewed), who had been exposed
to trauma prior to leaving Iraq and who was suffering
symptoms of PTSD, according to criteria outlined in 4th
edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM IV- TR, American Psychiatric Association) was read aloud by the interviewer (see Additional
file 1). A prompt card in Arabic was provided so that the
participant could follow the description as it was read and
participants were advised they could refer back to vignette
at any time during the interview. Following the presentation of vignette, participants were asked: ‘What would you
say is Miriam’s/Dawood’s main problem’? Participants
were required to choose only one answer from a number
of options. Listed in random, these were: ‘fear’; ‘no real
problem’; ‘just a phase’; ‘depression’; ‘weak character’; ‘nervous breakdown’; ‘posttraumatic stress disorder’; ‘serious
medical condition (e.g. brain tumour)’; ‘stress’; ‘not integrating well in Australia/homesickness’; and ‘physical condition (e.g. migraine or back pain). Participants beliefs
about helpfulness of various interventions for the problem
described in vignette were also assessed (Table 1). Specifically, participants were asked whether each of a
number of interventions within each of two categories –
treatments activities and people, would be helpful, harmful

most helpful for this person.
General psychological distress

To assess the general symptoms of anxiety and depression, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) [20]

Slewa-Younan et al. BMC Psychiatry 2014, 14:320
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/14/320

was used. The K10 is a self-report questionnaire of depression and general mental disorder. Scores range
from 10 to 50, with established thresholds of low to
mild (10-21), moderate (22-29) and severe distress
(≥30) applied to provide a measure of symptoms among
the participants. The K10 has good psychometric properties with internal consistency of α = .86 reported for
Arabic speaking refugees [21]. Cronbach’s alpha in the
current study was .94.
Trauma and PTSD symptoms

The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) [22] is a
widely used, cross-cultural self-report checklist assessing
the occurrence and frequency of various types of traumatic events as well as PTSD symptomatology. It consists of four parts: part I, which assesses the number and
types of potentially traumatic events (PTE) experienced
and/or witnessed, part II, an open ended description of
the traumatic narrative, part III enquires about head injury, and part IV, which addresses the occurrence and
severity of PTSD symptomatology. Only parts I and IV
were included in the present study, being directly relevant to the assessment of PTSD. A score of 2.5 or above
on Part IV is considered to indicate a high probability of
clinically significant PTSD symptomatology [22]. The HTQ
has very good psychometric properties, including high testretest reliability and internal consistency for part IV [22].
Cronbach’s alpha in the current study was .93.

Page 4 of 8

Missing data was low, in the order of 7.2% and was handled by listwise deletion. Where appropriate, data for levels
of general psychological distress and PTSD symptomatology derived from the Second (2007) Australian National
Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHWB) [24]
and responses from the 2011 National Survey of Mental
Health Literacy and Stigma (NSMHLS) [16] were used for
comparative purposes.

Results
Interviews were conducted with a total of 225 participants over the 10-month data collection period. Their
demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in
Table 2.
Clinical characteristics

Approximately one third (31.1%) of participants met the
threshold (≥2.5) for clinically significant PTSD symptomatology according to the HTQ. In comparison, reported rates of PTSD in NSMHWB ranged from 6.4%
for 12 months prevalence to 12.2% for lifetime presence,
which are between two to five fold less than in our sample.
According to the cut-off scores for the K10 used in the
NSMHWB, 39.1% of participants had severe psychological

With 225 respondents, the study had 80% power at 5%
significance level to detect a medium effect size of between 0.19 to 0.24 using 1 to 5 degrees of freedom Chisquare test, and an effect size of 0.38 for Mann-Whitney
tests of associations between key demographic variables,
symptom levels and specific aspects of MHL.
Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0. Continuous variables are presented as
median and interquartile range (IQR), whereas categorical
variables were expressed as percentage (%) frequencies.
The effect of socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex,
length of time in Australia, religion and education) and
symptom levels on the K10 and HTQ Part IV (as defined
in the scale descriptions) on responses regarding problem recognition and beliefs about interventions were
examined using Mann-Whitney U tests, Kruskal-Wallis
tests, Spearman’s rank correlations or Chi-square tests, as
appropriate (for the purpose of this analysis, responses to
questions concerning the perceived helpfulness of particular interventions were recoded: helpful = 1, harmful = -1,
and neither = 0). Pairwise post hoc comparisons of significant socio-demographic characteristics were performed
using Dunn’s procedure [23] with a Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons, with adjusted p-values reported.

distress, 18.7% had moderate distress, and 37.8% low to
mild distress. By way of comparison, 2.6% of the general
Australian population experienced severe psychological
distress according to the 2007 NSMHWB [24].
Mental Health Literacy Survey

In response to the question ‘What would you say is
Miriam’s/Dawood’s main problem?’ 94 respondents (41.8%)
chose fear, and a further 44 (19.6%) chose depression. Only
32 respondents (14.2%) used the correct psychiatric label of
PTSD, whereas 26 (11.6%) believed it was a nervous
breakdown. Collectively, these responses accounted for
87.2% of all responses. By way of comparison, 34.3% of the
general Australian public surveyed in the 2011 National
Survey of Mental Health Literacy and Stigma (NSMHLS)
[16] gave the correct psychiatric label to a PSTD vignette.
Table 1 shows the percentage of respondents who considered interventions within each subcategory (treatments or people) as ‘helpful’, ‘harmful’ or ‘neither’, for the
problem described. As can be seen, reading the Koran or
Bible was the treatment most frequently indicated as being
helpful by participants (80.0%). Next most commonly
endorsed helpful activity was ‘finding new hobbies’
(76.0%), followed by 73.3% citing ‘psychotherapy focusing on relationships with others’. The single most helpful treatments were reading the Koran or Bible (19.1%)
and ‘psychotherapy focusing on changing thoughts’
(17.3%). By comparison, the top three helpful interventions selected by participants in the NSMHLS were
‘physical activity’ (93.5%) ‘get out more’ (88%), and
‘learn relaxation’ (87.9%). Of concern is the finding
that 57.8% of the Iraqi participants reported that ‘trying to deal with the problem alone’ would be helpful,
which is in direct contrast to 6% of respondents in
NSMHLS who believed such an action would be helpful. In terms of assistance from people, the Iraqi participants most frequently cited psychiatrists as being
helpful (84.9%), followed by a family member (67.1%)
and GP (66.7%). In the NSMHLS, by comparison, the
persons considered most likely to be helpful were counsellors (91.3%), GPs (85.6%) and psychiatrists (84.2%).
Factors affecting response to particular questions

Significant differences between the main problem identified and demographic factors were found only for time
spent in Australia variable (H(9) = 22.61, p = .007). The
post hoc analysis showed significant differences in median time spent in Australia for participants describing
the problem in the vignette as “just a phase” (33.67) and
those selecting “homesickness” (186.25) (p = 0.013) or
“physical condition” (222.50) (p = 0.017), indicating that
participants who recently arrived in Australia were more
likely to describe the problem as “just a phase”.

Page 5 of 8

Significant differences were also found among most helpful treatments and length of stay in Australia (H(16) =
31.17, p = 0.013). In particular, participants who recently
arrived in Australia were significantly more likely to select
“trying to deal with a problem alone” compared with
“admission to psychiatric hospital” among those who
had been living in Australia longer.
With regards to individual treatment helpfulness, participants who had been living in Australia longer were more
likely to endorse activities such reading a self-help book
(rs = .224, p = .001), reading the Bible or Koran (rs = .181,
p = .007) and improving diet/exercise (rs = .169, p = .012),
and less likely to endorse drinking alcohol (rs = -0.212,
p = 0.002) as helpful compared with those who were
more recently resettled in Australia. Those with higher
levels of education (12 years or more) were more likely
to believe that finding new hobbies (rs = .247, p < .001)
as being helpful. Christians were more likely to consider “psychotherapy focused on changing thinking” as
helpful than Mandaeans (p = .018, Mean Rank = 122.79,
and 93.74 respectively), whereas Mandaeans were more
likely to consider “traditional therapy” as helpful as
Christians (p = 0.016, Mean Rank = 129.11 and 97.60
respectively). Participants without probable PTSD were
more likely to believe that getting information about
the problem would be a helpful activity (p = .012, Mean
Rank = 116.14, and 96.07, respectively).
In terms of treatment providers, those participants
who had been living in Australia for longer believed that
GPs (rs = .208, p = .002), psychologists (rs = .231, p = .001),
community mental health teams (rs = .241, p < .001) and
telephone counselling (rs = .208, p = .002) were more helpful compared to those recently arrived. Muslims were
more likely than Christians to believe that seeking help
from “close male friend” is helpful (p = .008, Mean
Rank = 121.88, and 96.24 respectively).

Discussion
Knowledge of mental health disorders and beliefs about
the helpfulness of treatments are aspects considered to
be central to mental health literacy. This is the first
comprehensive study of the MHL of resettled Iraqi refugees. Our results indicated that only 14.2% of the sample
survey used the correct psychiatric label of PTSD to describe the problem in the vignette and that this was not
influenced by participants’ socio-demographic characteristics or their symptomology levels. Most participants
believed that reading a religious text such as the Bible or
Koran and seeking help from a psychiatrist were the interventions most likely to be helpful for someone suffering from symptoms described in the vignette. There was
some variation in beliefs regarding treatment according
the length of time in Australia of the respondents and
their levels of education and religious affiliations.

Slewa-Younan et al. BMC Psychiatry 2014, 14:320
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/14/320

In the 2011 NSMHLS [16], 34.4% of the general
Australian public surveyed was able to correctly label
PTSD when presented with such a clinical vignette. By
comparison, less than half that number; 14.2% of our
sample was able to label the problem described in the
vignette as being PTSD. This figure is even more concerning given that close to one third of participants in
the current study had clinically significant symptoms
that indicated a probable diagnosis of PTSD. In May
et al.’s recent study [18], 84.4% of participants reported
that the PTSD vignette described a mental health
problem. However, recognition of PTSD per se was not
examined in this latter study. While it could be argued
that knowledge of the Western psychiatric label of
PTSD is not necessary for help-seeking, there is evidence
that self-labelling as having a particular mental disorder activates a schema about appropriate action to
take and helps recognition of the disorder by health
practitioners [15].
In terms of interventions for the problem described in
the vignette, it is interesting that reading religious texts
and seeking help from a psychiatrist were the interventions most often rated as helpful, given that these interventions could be seen to be at odds with each other.
Indeed, one can be seen to represent beliefs regarding
external higher powers while the other stems from a
medical based model of mental health treatment dominant in western nations. A contentious issue in transcultural psychiatry has been the notion of whether the
Western-based medical model is able to meet the needs
of refugee populations, given the different cultural and
social circumstances, and different views about mental
health and its treatment of the latter [25]. May and
colleagues [18] similarly found evidence for complex
beliefs systems regarding treatment where both mental
health professionals and religious leaders were considered helpful. These results suggesting the existence of
complex multi-layered mental health beliefs amongst
resettled Iraqi refugees are supported by our study,
and have implications for treatment programs. Specifically, the study suggests that transcultural mental health
services in Australia should consider ways to collaborate with traditional and religious leaders of Iraqi communities in order to better service the needs of such
populations.
Of concern, was the finding that a high level of participants who believed that dealing with the problem described in the vignette alone would be helpful (58%).
This was almost 10 times greater than the number of
participants (6%) in the 2011 NSMHLS who endorsed
dealing with the problem alone as helpful, and indicates
an immediate area for improving the mental health education of refugees. Previous research on factors associated with dealing with mental health problems alone

Page 6 of 8

have demonstrated associations with the male gender
and beliefs the disorder described is self-limiting and
due to personal weakness [26]. Further research seeking
to examine such associations in refugee samples is needed
and will be reported upon in due course.
Other findings from our study offer more specific directions for mental health promotion and interventions.
The finding that length of resettlement time influences
problem recognition and beliefs in treatment helpfulness
is important. For example, the finding that recently arrived respondents were more likely to believe the problem described in the vignette is ‘just a phase’ bears
direct relevance to treatment seeking. Furthermore, the
belief that drinking alcohol is possibly helpful held by
the same sub-group is of concern and should be addressed. One way these differing beliefs can be addressed
is by providing culturally adapted, translated educational
material on common symptoms reported after experiencing a traumatic events, self-help strategies and treatment pathways, as part of refugee’s orientation on arrival
to Australia. In terms of mental health clinicians working with resettled Iraqi refugees, it may be useful to bear
in mind the possible differences in the acceptability of
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) amongst different
religions. Defined in our survey as “psychotherapy focused on changing thoughts”, those from a Christian
background were more likely to select it as helpful compared with those from Mandaean backgrounds. This
important to note, given that CBT is considered best
practice in the treatment of PTSD [27] and the widespread use amongst Western-based clinicians.
Limitations of the current study should be noted.
These include the use of self-report measures of mental
health and the inclusion of a measure of general psychological distress rather than separate measures of anxiety
and affective disorders. Although we recruited participants from western Sydney, which has the highest concentration of resettling Iraqi refugees in Australia, given
our sample were volunteers from those who attended
English classes, our participants may be more acculturated than others. Strengths of the study, in our view,
were the use of a culturally adapted vignette describing
PTSD, the relatively large sample size, which permitted
analysis of associations between demographic characteristics and measures of mental health literacy, the administration of the survey instrument by means of in-person
interviews and the recruitment of participants from a
non-clinical setting.

Conclusions
In summary, the current findings suggest that resettled
Iraqi refugees in Australia have low levels of problem
