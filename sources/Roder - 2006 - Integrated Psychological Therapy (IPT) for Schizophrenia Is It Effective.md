Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT) for Schizophrenia: Is It Effective?

Introduction
Until recently, the treatment of schizophrenia was
grounded in pharmacotherapy with conventional antipsychotics, nonspecific social rehabilitation, and supportive or insight-oriented psychotherapy. However,
over the past 2 decades, there has been a sea change in
treatment philosophy and technology for schizophrenia,
as exemplified by the following advances: (1) a paradigm
shift in the locus of treatment from the hospital to the
community,1–3 including the development of the Assertive Community Treatment model4 for ensuring continuity of care for severely ill and difficult to engage patients;
(2) the focus on work as a rehabilitation goal and the validation of the supported employment model for improving employment outcomes5; (3) the development of
atypical neuroleptics with a more benign side effect profile6–8; (4) an improved understanding of the role of neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits as mediators of
functional and community outcomes9–21; and (5) a growing body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of
specifically targeted, standardized, predominantly cognitive-behavioral interventions.22–29 This last group of
approaches can be divided into 4 groups based on their
respective objectives as follows25,30,31: (1) family therapy
approaches, (2) social skills and problem-solving training, (3) neurocognitive remediation, and (4) cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to reduce persistent positive
symptoms.
The preponderance of research on the specifically targeted interventions listed above focuses on a single treatment approach. An exception to this is the Integrated
Psychological Therapy (IPT), which combines neurocognitive remediation with training in social cognition, social
skills, and problem solving.31–33 This review explicates
the IPT model and summarizes research conducted on
it over the past 25 years.

Against the background of evidence-based treatments for
schizophrenia, nowadays the implementation of specific
cognitive and behavioral interventions becomes more important in the standard care of these patients. Over the past
25 years, research groups in 9 countries have carried out
30 independent evaluations of Integrated Psychological
Therapy (IPT), a group program that combines neurocognitive and social cognitive interventions with social skills
approaches for schizophrenic patients. The aim of the
present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of IPT under
varying treatment and research conditions in academic and
nonacademic sites. In a first step, all 30 published IPT studies
with the participation of 1393 schizophrenic patients were
included in the meta-analysis. In a second step, only highquality studies (HQS) (7 studies including 362 patients)
were selected and analyzed to check whether they confirmed
the results of the first step. Positive mean effect sizes favoring
IPT over control groups (placebo-attention conditions, standard care) were found for all dependent variables, including
symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and neurocognition.
Moreover, the superiority of IPT continued to increase during an average follow-up period of 8.1 months. IPT obtained
similarly favorable effects across the different outcome
domains, assessment formats (expert ratings, self-reports,
and psychological tests), settings (inpatient vs outpatient
and academic vs nonacademic), and phases of treatment
(acute vs chronic). The HQS confirmed the results of the
complete sample. The analysis indicates that IPT is an effective rehabilitation approach for schizophrenia that is robust
across a wide range of patients and treatment conditions.

IPT
IPT is a group-based CBT program for schizophrenia
that integrates neurocognitive and social cognitive remediation with psychosocial rehabilitation. IPT is based on
the underlying assumption that basic deficits in neurocognitive functioning have a pervasive effect on higher
levels of behavioral organization, including social skills
and social and independent functioning.9,34–36 Based

on this, successful psychosocial rehabilitation requires remediation of both underlying neurocognitive impairments and related social cognitive deficits, as well as
building social, self-care, and vocational skills. IPT
strives to integrate neurocognitive with psychosocial rehabilitation in a systematic, manualized fashion with the
end goal of improved social competence. IPT is organized
into 5 subprograms (figure 1). As the later subprograms
build on the earlier ones, they are taught sequentially, beginning with neurocognition and social cognition, and
followed by communication and social skills, and then
problem-solving skills. The first subprogram primarily
targets basic impairments in neurocognition (eg, attention, verbal memory, cognitive flexibility, concept formation). Remediation of neurocognitive deficits in IPT
differs from conventional computer-based training
approaches that emphasize repetitive training (rehearsal
learning) of so-called ‘‘cold’’ cognitions in that specific
interactive exercises are practiced through engaging
group exercises, where patients learn alternative strategies for achieving individual goals (strategy learning).27
The second subprogram addresses deficits in social cognition (eg, social and emotional perception, emotional expression). The fourth and fifth subprograms focus on
building patients’ social competence through practice
of interpersonal skills (eg, role plays) and group-based
problem-solving exercises. The third subprogram serves
as a bridge between the first 2 and last 2 subprograms
by focusing on neurocognitive skills that directly impact
on interpersonal communication, such as verbal fluency
and executive functioning. The specific targeted goals for
each individual subprogram depend on each patient’s
deficits and strengths and the functional outcomes that
are the focus of treatment.31
In order to capitalize on advances made in understanding and rehabilitation of social cognition, and social and
problem-solving behavior, the original IPT model was
modified to include Emotional Management Therapy37,38 together with specific skills training programs
to address vocational, residential skills, and recreational
topics.39–41 Because IPT was one of the first systematic,
comprehensive, and manualized treatment approaches
for schizophrenia, it has been wide adopted, especially
in Europe. The German edition of the IPT manual is
in its fifth printing,31 and has been translated into 10 languages. Furthermore, a growing body of research has
been conducted to evaluate the effects of IPT, but no
comprehensive reviews of this literature have been published. Therefore, the time is ripe for a review.
Methods
Over the past 25 years, research groups in 9 countries
have conducted 30 studies investigating IPT or a combination of several IPT subprograms, with a total sample
(TS) of 1393 patients with schizophrenia (diagnosed

according to International Classification of Diseases or
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).
All study investigators were in contact with the IPT research group in Bern, Switzerland, which supervised
some of them in treatment procedure. An additional literature search of IPT studies independent of language in
international data sources (e.g., Medline, WebSPIRS) using the key words ‘‘schizophrenia,’’ ‘‘IPT,’’ ‘‘behavior
therapy,’’ or ‘‘cognitive therapy’’ found to no further
IPT studies. With no exception, all 30 IPT studies
were included in the analysis. Sample size, patient characteristics, state of illness, design, setting, and site conditions were extracted independently by 2 of us each, and
differences were resolved by consensus after review. In 2
of the studies under review, IPT was compared with standard care (pharmacotherapy and social therapy) and with
a placebo-attention condition (nonspecific group activity). In 11 studies, IPT was compared with standard
care, in 10 studies with a placebo-attention condition,
and in 2 studies, IPT was used as a control condition
compared with another treatment approach. Five studies
had no control group. These studies are summarized in
table 1.
IPT has been provided to patients at different stages of
their illness (eg, immediately following the postacute
phase of a symptom exacerbation, in stabilized patients
exhibiting continuing or residual symptoms between episodes) in a variety of different locations (eg, inpatient and
outpatient settings in academic and nonacademic institutions). The characteristics of these studies vary in terms of
sample size and design; in 25 studies (83.3%), a controlled

design was used, while in 16 of these studies (64%),
patients were randomized to IPT or another treatment.
In 24 studies (80%), expert ratings of outcome were conducted, with blind ratings obtained in 8 (26.7%) studies.
The heterogeneity of the scientific quality of studies on
IPT can be attributed to changing therapy settings and
designs over the 25-year period during which the research
was conducted. For example, earlier studies tended to
have smaller sample sizes, were less likely to employ a randomized controlled trial design, and provided a higher

frequency of therapy sessions in predominantly inpatient
settings (Spearman’s correlation, 1-tailed: r > .30, P <
.05, K studies $ 28).
We conducted a meta-analysis in order to evaluate the
effectiveness of IPT in adults with schizophrenia (age >
18 years) when applied under varying clinical conditions.
The only study74 including adolescents is reviewed separately. In order to cover the full spectrum of different
treatment conditions, in the first step, all 30 IPT studies
were included. Of special interest are (1) the global therapy

effect, defined as the mean of all assessed outcome variables referring to documented symptom dimensions,
neurocognitive and social functioning, quality of life,
well being, and treatment satisfaction at the end of therapy and at follow-up; (2) separate symptom dimensions
and functional impairments, including neurocognition
(attention, memory, executive functioning), psychopathology (negative and positive symptoms), and psychosocial functioning (social and role functioning, self-care,
occupational skills); (3) singular tests used in different
studies to control the comparability of the assessments
addressing different symptom and functional domains;
(4) moderators of treatment response, including patient
characteristics (eg, gender), setting (eg, inpatient/outpatient), and site conditions (eg, academic and nonacademic
sites); and (5) predictors of outcome defined as the influence on outcome by moderating variables of patient characteristics and setting.
In the second step, we evaluated whether methodological rigor of the studies contributed to the observed effects
by comparing the results of the complete sample of IPT
studies with those of a subset of 7 rigorously controlled
studies.50,55,58,60,62,64,66 Rigorously controlled studies
were defined as those which employed a controlled study
design including randomization of patients to different
treatment groups, fixed dosage of neuroloptics or statistically controlled change of medication, clearly stated
blind ratings, and complete explication of data for the
different dimensions of symptoms and functional
domains that were assessed.
Data Analysis
To determine the extent of change in patients across
the different control conditions, effect sizes (ESs) within
the comparison groups were first calculated: ES =
(Mpre  Mpost or follow-up) / SDpre of pooled groups.77 As clinical studies have indicated higher ESs for patients in placebo-attention conditions than for patients receiving
standard treatment,64,78 these 2 types of control groups
were dealt with separately. In addition, between groups
ES were calculated according to Cohen’s d.79 ES can generally be categorized as small (0.2), medium (0.5), or large
(0.8).79 The possible influence of unequal sample sizes
and SEs between the studies was statistically controlled
by using a fixed effects model in which the ES of each
study was weighted by its inverse variance (ESw, dw).80
The homogeneity of variance of the ES of the individual
studies was tested by calculating Hedges’s QW.81 To measure the significance of the weighted ES, the confidence
interval and z transformation of the ES were used.80 Differences between groups were evaluated by calculating
Hedges’s QB.81 In order to weigh the strength of the findings against the possibility of publication bias toward
more favorable results (ie, the ‘‘file drawer problem’’),
we calculated the number of unpublished studies with
no effects that would be needed to negate the overall posS84

of outcome were evaluated by calculating nonparametric
Spearman’s correlation coefficients.
Results
The patient characteristics of the entire sample comprising 1367 adult patients in 29 studies are displayed
in table 2. As a result of the different phases of patient
rehabilitation in each study, the duration of illness and
hospitalization is heterogeneous. All studies provided
pharmacological treatment for patients, and 8 studies
provided information on the daily dosage of antipsychotics.
Therapy Setting and Dropout Rate
The mean treatment period was 17.2 weeks (95% confidence interval, CI, 11.8–22.6 weeks) or 49.3 hours (95%
CI, 37.5–61.1). The mean number of therapy sessions was
44.4 (95% CI, 37.7–54.0) with a mean frequency of 3.2
sessions a week (95% CI, 2.7–3.7). In 14 studies
(48.3%), the professional qualifications of the therapist
were stated. In 13 of these studies (92.8%), primarily cognitive-behavioral–trained psychologists were involved,
and in 5 studies (35.7%), psychiatrists trained in IPT participated as therapists. Fifteen studies (52%) indicated the
dropout rate from the treatment period, and five of these
(33.3%) also provided information on dropout from the
entire study including follow-up (treatment and followup phase). The average dropout rate during the treatment
period was 14.7% (95% CI, 7.8–21.6), and during the entire trial, it was 15.6% (95% CI, 0.2–31.0).
Effect of IPT on Global Therapy Outcome
IPT had significantly higher ESs (ESw) compared with
both control conditions for changes from baseline to
the posttreatment assessment (QB = 12.59, df = 2, P <
.01, 1-tailed) (table 3). Placebo-attention conditions

exhibited small ESw, which significantly differed from
zero. These differed only marginally from those of the
groups receiving standard treatment (QB = 3.54, df = 1,
P < .1). The superiority of the IPT group was maintained
at a follow-up at an average 8.1 months later (QB = 8.29,
df = 2, P < .05). The single study with adolescent inpatients74 found a moderate ES favoring IPT combined
with psychoeducation (ES = .59) compared with psychoeducation alone (ES = .41).
Symptom Dimensions and Functional Impairments
There were highly significant improvements for the IPT
group in neurocognition, psychopathology, and psychosocial functioning (table 3). With reference to the control
conditions, only the placebo-attention group showed significant improvement in psychopathology. A betweengroup comparison showed a marked superiority of IPT
compared with the control conditions—most notably
with respect to the neurocognitive domain and psychosocial functioning (QB > 9.34, df = 2, P < .01) but not
psychopathology (QB = 5.74, df = 2, P < .1). When the
2 control conditions were combined, IPT yielded significantly higher symptom reduction (QB = 5.19, df = 1, P <
.05). The findings pertaining to positive and negative
symptoms were similar to those with the combined psychopathology factor.

IPT for all 3 assessment formats as follows: self-report
(questionnaire), interview (expert rating by interviewS86

ing patient or related person), and psychological testing (paper-pencil or computer-based tests to assess
predominantly neurocognitive and social cognitive
performance) (table 3). Moreover, the IPT effects
for these 3 formats were markedly homogenous
(QB = 0.31, df = 2, not significant [NS]). Self-report
and interview ratings yielded significant findings in
the placebo-attention condition as well. There was
a strong correspondence between self- and interview
ratings in the IPT group (Spearman’s correlation, 2tailed: r = .74, P < .01, K studies = 14). Furthermore,
the 3 most frequently used assessment instruments
(Attention-Stress Test, d283; Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale, BPRS84; the Global Assessment of Functioning
Scale, GAF) had an average 24% higher weighted
effects for the IPT group than the variables subsumed
under the 3 domains of functioning. Thus, a significant
superiority of IPT vs the 2 control conditions in
regard to the BPRS was shown, in contrast to the
combined domain of psychopathology (QB = 6.62,
df = 2, P < .05).
Centers
The possible influences of institutional conditions, treatment settings, or stage of illness on the effects of IPT were
evaluated by first combining the 2 control conditions in
order to maximize the cell size of the comparison group.
The ESs of IPT and the combined control groups are displayed in table 4.
Taken as a whole, the academic center studies yielded
slightly larger effects than nonacademic center studies,

Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT) for Schizophrenia

with regard to both IPT and to the control groups. IPT
had significantly greater improvements in both settings.
In academic centers, the control groups also achieved significant improvements during the treatment phase. The 4
multicenter studies with predominantly nonacademic
participation had broader variance yield effects and
were comparable to the other nonacademic centers.
The differences based on institutional conditions were
not significant (QB < 1.24, df = 2, NS) for either IPT
or the control group.
Treatment Setting
Studies using samples of exclusively inpatients or outpatients both showed highly significant within-group effects
for IPT (table 4). When compared with the control group,
IPT was significantly better only for inpatients (QB =
9.33, df = 1, P < .01) and marginally significantly better
for outpatients (QB = 3.65, df = 1, P < .1). Although inpatients in the control conditions showed significant
improvements during the treatment period, neither IPT
nor the control conditions differed with respect to treatment settings (QB < 0.42, df = 1, NS). During the therapy
and follow-up periods, IPT inpatients had significantly
greater improvements (K = 4, follow-up = 10 months;
ESw = .79, 95% CI, 0.43–1.16) than IPT outpatients
(K = 2, follow-up = 7.5 months; ESw = .44, 95% CI,
0.07–0.80). Whereas outpatients maintained the improvements made during therapy at follow-up, inpatients continued to improve during the follow-up period (QB = 8.46,
df = 1, P < .01). Consistent with the presumed more acute
or more severe stage of psychiatric illness in the hospital,
inpatients had more pronounced psychopathology on the
BPRS84 (K = 12; BPRS total score: mean [SD], 47.8 [8.7])
than outpatients (K = 4; BPRS total score: mean [SD],
40.2 [11.8]).
Stage of Illness
IPT showed significant effects for both symptomstabilized patients and postacute patients (see table 4).
No significant effects were found for the control group;
postacute patients showed small ESw, while symptomstabilized patients showed no effects during the therapy
phase. At the beginning of therapy, postacute IPT and
control patients exhibited more marked neurocognitive
deficits (K = 4; d2 standard value83: mean [SD], 88.3
[3.5]) than symptom-stabilized patients (K = 5; d2 standard value: mean [SD], 101.7 [21.8]). IPT was significantly more effective than the control group only for
symptom-stabilized patients (QB = 11.17, df = 1, P <
.01). The stage of illness had no influence on the efficacy
of IPT (QB = 0.02, df = 1, NS). For the posttherapy period, IPT patients whose symptoms were stabilized maintained the effects achieved during therapy at follow-up
(K = 6, follow-up = 9.7 months; ES = .64, ESw = .53,
95% CI, 0.29–0.77).

IPT Subprograms
In each of the studies, a variety of different IPT subprograms was provided. Twelve studies used the ‘‘cognitive
differentiation,’’ ‘‘social perception,’’ and/or ‘‘verbal communication’’ subprograms (SP-Part I). Five studies only
utilized the ‘‘social skills’’ and ‘‘interpersonal problemsolving’’ subprograms (SP-Part II), while 12 studies
employed all 5 IPT subprograms (IPT-Complete). All 3
IPT variations showed highly significant global therapy
effects during the therapy period (SP-Part I: ES = .58;
ESw = .58, 95% CI, 0.39–0.77; SP-Part II: ES = .54;
ESw = .52, 95% CI, 0.26–0.78; IPT-Complete: ES =
.51; ESw = .46, 95% CI, 0.32–0.61). The medium weighted
effects of the 3 IPT variations were homogeneous (QB =
0.92, df = 2, NS).
With respect to the specific domains of functioning,
patients receiving SP-Part I attained the highest
weighted effects in the neurocognitive domain (K =
12; ES = .72; ESw = .71, 95% CI, 0.51–0.90) and the
smallest in psychosocial functioning (K = 7; ES = .38;
ESw = .37, 95% CI, 0.13–0.61) compared with those receiving SP-Part II and IPT-Complete. A between-group
comparison of the 3 IPT variations revealed no significant findings with regard to the 3 outcome domains
(QB < 4.59, df = 2, NS). In order to evaluate whether
the effects at follow-up of providing the complete IPT
program were stronger than providing only some of
the subprograms, we combined studies that provided
only SP-Part I or II and compared them with IPTComplete. An assessment after a posttherapy followup averaging 8.3 months for SP-Part I or II (K = 3)
and 7.9 months for IPT-Complete (K = 5), yielded significant improvements for both groups compared with
the baseline. The weighted effects of therapy and of
the posttherapy period were 25% higher for IPTComplete (ES = .74; ESw = .60, 95% CI, 0.39–0.81)
than for SP-Part I or II (ES = .50; ESw = .48, 95%
CI, 0.13–0.82), although this difference was not statistically significant (QB = 0.35, df = 1, NS).
Predictors of Outcome
The duration of illness was the only independent patient
variable that had a negative effect on the global therapy
outcome of IPT (mean effect) (K = 19, Spearman’s correlation, 2-tailed: r = .64, P < .01). Patients who had
a longer duration of illness tended to benefit less from
IPT. In contrast, age and duration of hospitalization
had a moderate negative effect on the global therapy outcome in the combined control conditions (K > 10, r <
.50, P < .06). The duration of therapy (in weeks or
hours), the number of therapy sessions, or the weekly frequency of therapy sessions did not correlated with the
global therapy outcome IPT (K = 27, r < .30, NS). However, a longer duration of therapy favorably affected
improvement in functional outcome (K = 19, r = .47,
S87

V. Roder et al.

When dw of the global therapy effect was converted
into a correlation coefficient, r = .20. This means that
according to Rosenthal’s Binomial Effect Size Display,82
an average of 60% of the IPT patients and 40% of the
control patients benefited from their respective treatments. To address the issue of publication bias toward
positive results, based on Rosenthal82 we calculated
that a minimum of 108 IPT studies showing no effect
(Z = 0, P = .05) would be needed to negate the positive
effects of IPT compared with the control group based on
this analysis (K = 21; r = .20, Z = .89).

Therapy (IPT) and Control Group (CG). aSignificant weighted

P < .05). Within this context, the study conducted by
Takai et al61 was an exception, inasmuch as it yielded
small mean effects (ES = .17) in spite of providing only
a single weekly session over more than 1 year of therapy
(60 sessions).
The effects of IPT on the specific outcome domains
were partially intercorrelated during the therapy period.
Improvement in neurocognition was significantly correlated with improvement in psychopathology (K = 19, r =
.52, P < .05) and functional outcome (K = 15, r = .51, P <
.05). However, the correlation between improvement in
psychopathology and functional outcome was not significant (K = 17, r = .08, NS).
Furthermore, the improvement in global therapy outcome from baseline to follow-up assessment was significantly correlated with improvement from baseline to
posttherapy (K = 8, r = .91, P < .01). Changes in the neurocognitive domain (K = 6, r = .89, P < .05) and in psychopathology (K = 8, r = .79, P < .05) during therapy
predicted mean follow-up effects. Improvements in these
2 domains also correlated significantly with a lower dropout rate (K = 11, r < .60, P < .05).
ESs Between Comparison Groups
In calculating ESs (d) between IPT and comparison
groups, a subsample of studies including control conditions was selected (K = 21; N = 900 patients). Patient characteristics and setting did not differ from those of the TS
(K = 29). The 2 control conditions were combined. In
comparison with the control conditions, IPT had significantly stronger global therapy effects during therapy and
at follow-up (therapy period: K = 21; d = .40; dw = .36,
95% CI, 0.23–0.50; therapy and follow-up phase: K =
6, d = .52; dw = .45, 95% CI, 0.91–0.71).
The superiority of IPT was also evident in the 3 specific
outcome domains (neurocognition: K = 18; d = .46; dw =
.41, 95% CI, 0.26–0.55; psychosocial functioning: K = 13;
d = .34; dw = .31, 95% CI, 0.15–0.48; psychopathology:
K = 16; d = .31; dw = .31, 95% CI, 0.16–0.46).

Methodological Rigor of Studies
To eliminate methodological and design-related bias, in
a second step we repeated the analyses including only
high-quality studies (HQS), as previously defined. In
all, 7 studies with a total of 362 patients met these criteria.
These studies did not differ from the Total Sample (TS)
(K = 29) in terms of patient characteristics or therapy
setting. Six of these studies recruited inpatients (85.7%)
exclusively. Four studies (57.1%) included blind ratings,
and three studies (42.9%) had no interview ratings. Three
of the studies were confined to IPT subprograms for
the neurocognitive and social cognitive domains (subprograms 1–3), while four studies provided the complete IPT
program. Five studies compared IPT with a placeboattention condition, one study compared IPT with standard care, and one study compared IPT with both control
conditions. The weighted medium ES for global therapy
outcome of IPT and combined control groups of the
HQS was similar to that of the TS (figure 2).
The global therapy effect of the HQS and the remaining studies of the TS (non-HQS, K = 22) did not differ
with respect to the IPT group or the control group
(QB < 0.19, df = 1, NS). The superiority of IPT vs the
control conditions was statistically significant for the
HQS (QB = 4.02, df = 1, P < .05), as well as for
the TS (QB = 12.66, df = 1, P < .01). The effects of the
HQS across therapy and the follow-up period were higher
than those of the TS but were identical to those of the
inpatient subpopulation in the TS because HQS included
predominantly inpatients. Once again, the HQS and nonHQS did not differ (QB = 0.81, df = 1, NS). As with the TS
(see table 3), the IPT patients in the HQS showed significant improvements in all 3 specific domains: neurocognition (K = 6; ES = .52; ESw = .48, 95% CI, 0.27–0.70),
psychosocial functioning (K = 4; ES = .55; ESw = .62,
95% CI, 0.33–0.92), and psychopathology (K = 5; ES =
.50; ESw = .49, 95% CI, 0.26–0.72). The HQS and nonHQS did also not differ in the specific domains (QB <
2.37, df = 1, NS).
With respect to the selection criterion of ‘‘blind ratings’’ for the HQS, the comparison between this set of
studies and the TS on the interview rating variable is
of particular interest. There was no difference in global

Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT) for Schizophrenia

therapy outcome based on interviewer ratings of IPT in
the HQS compared with the TS of studies (K = 4; ES = .49;
ESw = .52, 95% CI, 0.35–0.60). In addition, there was
no significant difference between the HQS and the TS
in the effects on psychopathology ratings (TS: K = 19;
ES = .51; ESw = .45, 95% CI, 0.33–0.58; HQS: K = 3;
ES = .53; ESw = .49, 95% CI, 0.17–0.81) and on psychosocial functioning (TS: K = 17; ES = .43; ESw = .45, 95%
CI, 0.32–0.58; HQS: K = 4; ES = .55; ESw = .62, 95%
CI, 0.33–0.92).
Discussion
This meta-analysis includes randomized-controlled trials
as well as studies under routine psychiatric care, with
inpatient and outpatient samples in academic and nonacademic sites. Therefore, the results of this meta-analysis
have high generalizability to clinical and nonclinical settings and provide support for the effectiveness of IPT. In
comparison with nonspecific group therapy or standard
care, IPT yielded significantly higher global therapy
effects, which were present both following the completion
of therapy and were sustained at follow-up. The results of
studies with high methodological quality support the efficacy of IPT and did not differ from the less rigorous
studies.
The IPT group therapy approach differs from most
other psychosocial treatment approaches to schizophrenia in the integration of neurocognitive and psychosocial
rehabilitation methods. In contrast, family intervention,
CBT for psychosis, social skills training, and neurocognitive rehabilitation programs have primarily been
delivered as nonintegrated, independent programs.
Meta-analyses have generally supported the effectiveness
of family intervention and CBT for psychosis,25,26,29,85,86
although the data supporting social skills training and
neurocognitive remediation are weaker27,28,87–89 and
are the topic of some debate.30,90,91 The present findings
are of interest considering that the subprograms that
comprise IPT focus primarily on neurocognitive remediation and social skills training.
The positive effects of IPT on both neurocognitive
functioning and social behaviors reported in the present
meta-analysis, in light of the weaker effects of neurocognitive rehabilitation or skills training interventions
reported in some other meta-analyses, suggest that the
integration of neurocognitive remediation and psychosocial skills training may work synergistically to improve
both domains more effectively than either intervention
alone. This tentative conclusion is in line with a recent
study by Hogarty and colleagues,92 who found that ‘‘cognitive enhancement therapy,’’ which combines computerbased cognitive training exercises with individual and
group work on social cognition and psychosocial skills
development, had a significant impact on both neurocognitive functioning and psychosocial adjustment.

The studies included in this review covered a wide
range of settings, methods, and patient characteristics.
In order to understand the implications of the findings,
we discuss these issues below.
Assessment Formats
No differences were found between expert ratings by
interviews and self-reports. Among the studies included,
expert ratings and patient self-assessments were significantly correlated, even within nonblind study designs.
Most of the ratings used in IPT studies focus on social
behavior and psychopathology. Studies of neurocognitive functioning have generally failed to find a strong association between self-ratings and objective performance
in different neurocognitive domains.93,94 Thus, expert
ratings and self-reports may converge more in some areas
of functioning, such as social behavior than others, such
as neurocognition. In addition, it has been suggested that
neurocognition impairment may moderate the relationship between self-ratings and objective ratings of functional behavior.95
Outcome Domains and Operationalized Variables
A general finding in the psychosocial rehabilitation field
has been that interventions have their greatest effect on
the proximal outcomes that are the most immediate focus
of intervention.96,97 This was evident in several IPT studies.50,72 When compared with the control conditions, the
largest effects of IPT were obtained in neurocognitive
functioning, which is a major focus of IPT. In particular,
the effects of strategy learning imparted by the first IPT
subprogram are consistent with the meta-analytic findings for neurocognitive remediation.27 Moreover, the
larger effects of the IPT neurocognitive subprogram compared with other IPT variations on neurocognitive functioning is consistent with this observation. Similarly as
might be expected, when the IPT neurocognitive subprogram was used exclusively, the mean effects in functional
outcome were smaller compared with the additional or
alternative application of the social competence subprogram. These results point to the internal validity of the
IPT model and underscore the importance of domainspecific interventions for improving functioning in
schizophrenia.
All the IPT variations were also found to have clearly
superior effects on functional outcomes compared with
control conditions. But in line with other meta-analyses,
the IPT effects on psychosocial functioning tend to be
smaller than in neurocognition and psychopathology.23,25,30 Most notably, the measurement of social
functioning is problematic and difficult to operationalize
in a highly controlled environment such as an inpatient
setting,96,98 where the constituent elements of social
behavior may be very different than in less overtly controlled settings.
S89

V. Roder et al.

The maintenance of IPT effects during the follow-up
phase is consistent with the integrated model of mutual
impact of different levels of neurocognitive and psychosocial skills functioning.9,11,12 Only those patients who
participated in the complete IPT, including the neurocognition, social cognition, and social competence treatment
components, continued to improve during the follow-up
phase. In addition, a longer treatment duration contributed to greater improvement in functional outcome. In
accordance with recent studies,19,21,71,92,99–106 these
results further support the hypothesized generalization
of improved neurocognition and social skills to actual social behavior and suggest that improving the distal outcome of social functioning requires the close integration
of social and neurocognitive rehabilitation, such as in
IPT.
Psychiatric Care Conditions
The impact of IPT was unaffected by patient variables,
settings, or site conditions. The mean effects of inpatients
and outpatients during the therapy phase are similar to
findings reported on other meta-analyses of psychosocial
treatments.23,89 When interpreting the stronger effects for
inpatients during the follow-up phase, the more pronounced pathology of this group compared with outpatients must be taken into account. Symptom-stabilized
and postacute patients also displayed significant improvements under IPT. At the beginning of therapy, postacute patients exhibited larger selective attention deficits.
This finding is supported by an aggregation of empirical
findings on neurocognitive deficits (eg, selective attention) during the premorbid and remission phases as
well as during acute psychotic episodes.105 These selective
attention deficits may be improved through neurocognitive remediation in IPT, accounting for strong observed
effect.
With respect to the other patient variables, only duration of illness predicted lower success in IPT. In contrast,
the age and the duration of hospitalization predicted the
outcome for the control conditions but not IPT. Considering the small effects of the control interventions, older
patients with longer lasting hospitalizations failed to benefit. In comparison, these patients benefited from IPT
more than the control conditions. The marginal predictive value of the other patient variables was previously
noted by Mojtabai et al.23 In line with other studies of
psychosocial and neurocognitive approaches,23,27,92
treatment setting had no apparent influence on treatment
effects. However, the effects of IPT tended to be stronger
for studies carried out in academic centers than nonacademic settings, consistent with other findings,23 and
pointing to the need to conduct ‘‘effectiveness’’ research
in nonacademic settings which presumably have higher
generalizability to routine clinical settings where most
patients receive treatment.107
S90

Clinical Implications
During the 1980s, the frequency of IPT group therapy
varied between 2 and 5 sessions a week. In recent years,
however, a reduced regime of 2 weekly IPT sessions has
become accepted as standard. The use of a combination
of only some IPT subprograms for homogeneous groups
of selected patients based on a behavioral and problem
analysis31 would appear a reasonable, efficient, and
cost-effective treatment approach. In cases of more heterogeneous groups of patients with impaired functioning
across a broader range of domains, only the application
of the complete IPT would appear to produce sustainable
effects. Furthermore, the broad scope of IPT, including
neurocognitive, social cognitive, and psychosocial components, renders it suitable for patients in various states
of illness and with rehabilitation needs spanning the entire spectrum of psychiatric care. Therefore, IPT may be
useful in closing the gap between selective neurocognitive
or psychosocial interventions and nonspecific rehabilitation approaches in standard care for schizophrenic
patients.
Perspectives for Future Research
The findings of the present meta-analysis are naturally
subject to limitations of the methods used in the research
and the clinical applications of the IPT model. When
reviewing the results of the limited number of studies
of outpatients and postacute patients, the statistical testing of these studies had only modest power. Hence, further replication studies addressing these limitations are
desirable. To date, authoritative statements pertaining
to differential treatment indication, which also take the
individual course of rehabilitation, the impact of therapeutic variables, and relapse prevention into consideration, are lacking, not least owing to the available data
pool. In accordance with the National Institute of Mental
Health-Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative,10,12–17 the
coherence of differentiated functional domains during
the course of treatment and aftercare of IPT—especially
in the domains of neurocognition and social cognition
and its relation to functional and community outcome—
should be investigated in further controlled trials utilizing
adequate sample sizes.
