Abstract
Background: Generations of women living in Iraq endured three major regional wars and internal conflicts, which
weakened their psychological vulnerability and social role by poverty, displacements, and loss of their beloved ones. The
available literature about women’s mental health is scarce and does not signify the gender inequality and gender disparity
of mental disorders.
Method: During 1st August to October 2020, we explored the search engines: Google Scholar, Pub-Med, Medline, and
Clarivate using keywords of Iraq, gender inequality, women’s mental health, violence, and conflict, mental disorders,
gender-based violence, etc. From 1792 research items, 64 articles were scrutinized for this study. We selected the most
relevant studies with some available documents excluding data bout Immigrant women outside Iraq and reports from
foreign military sources.
Finding: Women living in Iraq have struggled for equality and empowerment since the 20th century. For the last four
decades, successive wars, economic sanction, gender-based violence, and internal conflicts have affected their development
endeavors. The 2003 US-led invasion caused a loss of lives, destruction of infrastructure, and forced displacement for tens
of thousands of civilians, including women and children. These atrocities increased women’s vulnerability to develop or
worsen the existing mental disorders. This review tries to attract world attention to women’s situations in Iraq.

Historical background
Iraq’s population increased from 23.55 to 40.22 million in
2000 to 2020, occupying a geographical area of 438,393
square kilometers, with about 71% live in urban areas.
Muslims and Arab constitute 96%, 80% of the Iraqi population, respectively. The primary language is Arabic, and
males comprise 50.2% and females 49.8%. The life expectancy at birth is 69.0 years for males and 73.2% for females,
and the total fertility rate is 3.7 (World Meter-Iraq Population,
2020). Iraq’s first constitution that was written in 1925
clearly stated that: ‘There shall be no differentiation in the
rights of Iraqis before the law, whatever differences may
exist in gender, language, race, or creed’ (British and Foreign
State Papers, 1931). After independence, the Iraqi government started robust longitudinal plans for building infrastructures, i.e., health system, electrical and water stations,
roads and bridges, and the modern justice system, and established pro-women legislation in a conservative patriarchal
community (United Nations Iraq, 2018).

supervision to control the drop-out of children. These
efforts decreased women’s illiteracy from (91%) in 1957
to (12%) in 1990 (Al-Shaikhly and Cui, 2017). At the
primary level, school enrollment’s gender gap almost disappeared during the 1980s (approximately 47% female
vs. 53% male). At the same time, 47% of colleges and
university graduates were females. In 1982, Iraq won the
United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) prize for eradicating adult illiteracy. The Iraqi provisional constitution of 1970, Article
19, guaranteed equal rights to all citizens before the law
regardless of sex, race, and religion. It ensured women’s
rights to own property and running for administrative or
political offices. Thus women acquired an advanced level
of freedom and independence compared to other Arab
neighboring countries (Issa and Jamil, 2010).

Education after 1990
Four days after the Iraqi army invaded Kuwait (2 August
1990), the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
imposed a comprehensive sanction against Iraq for 13 years
as political punishment. On 17 January 1991, over 120,000
allied raids were carried out in Iraq, destroying roads,
bridges, major power stations, water sanitation plants, telecommunications networks, and many civil buildings,
including schools and colleges (Al-Nasrawi, 2001). In addition to the direct damage by bombardment, education
organizations suffered a shortage of necessities; they were
unable to develop and upgrade the quality of education
because of the dramatic devaluation of the Iraqi currency
leading to minimum wages for all governmental employees.
The financial constraints discouraged many families from
sending their daughters to school, especially in rural areas.
The sanction caused deterioration of women’s education
where the illiteracy rate jumped from (12%) in 1990 to
(30.9%) in 1997. However, Iraqi women strived to prevent
the education system from total collapse (Al-Azzawi, 2011).

Education after 2003
On 21 March 2003, US-led coalition forces invaded Iraq
by airstrikes and ground war, causing vast destruction of
the state infrastructure, including education institutions,
where chaos and law-in order loss immediately took place
following the Iraqi government’s fall dismantling its military and security forces. Because of the security vacuum
and vandalism, 2,562 (84%) of schools, technical institutes, and universities were vandalized, burned, looted, or
occupied by invading forces. Iraqi women stepped backward in almost all aspects of their lives, which increased
gender-based discrimination in education, especially in
villages and remote provinces where 80.4% of girls were
enrolled in primary school. In comparison, 34.3% were
enrolled in secondary school, and the women’s illiteracy
rate exceeded 33.6%, which is 2.6 fold the male rate of
13%. (Al-Azzawi, 2011; UNESCO Office for Iraq National
Education Support Strategy, 2011). According to the Iraq
Mental Health Survey (IMHS), which included 4,332
adults, 27% of studied males were illiterate versus 37%
females during 2006/2007 (World Health Organization
(EMRO), 2007), another updated detailed report by
Vilardo and Bitter (2018) stated that only 39.5% of adult
women completed secondary school versus 56.5% of
males during 2017 to 2018. The gender gap in quitting
school rate was 5.4% for males and 11.4% for females,
with a regional disparity in conflict governorate regions.
The education disparity between urban and rural women
was also confirmed by the Woman Integrated Social and
Health Survey (I-WISH, 2012). The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) indicated that the illiteracy rate among rural women was 36.5% compared to

International Journal of Social Psychiatry 00(0)
15.9% for urban, and more than two-thirds (69.4%) have
not completed the educational level they aspired [1-WISH,
2012; UNDP, 2013). Those factors have severely undermined the Iraqi education system and ultimately increased
the gender disparity in the jobs market, especially in the
lead and executive positions.

2003 war-related violence
Since March 2003, Iraqi women have been besieged by
different forms of violence. The civil war and armed conflict in Iraq have led to approximately 14,000 women’s
violent deaths since 2003. In addition to the women killed
in bombings, shelling, and air attacks on civilian areas in
Iraq, a further 5,000 to 10,000 women and girls are estimated to have been abducted for ransom; women have
been deliberately targeted assassination by both pro-and
anti-government militias across the country during 2003 to
2015. Thousands of women and girls are estimated to have
been abducted or trafficked for sexual slavery or prostitution since 2003 (Lafta et al., 2015; United Nations-Iraq,
2013). According to Lasky et al. (2006), some U.S military
personnel have committed crimes of sexual abuse and
physical assault against women, particularly at detainment
centers, which in turn may expose them to ‘honor’ killing
when male relatives kill a woman who ‘defiled’ the family
name. The U.S. military tactics have also victimized
women and their families, subjecting them to aerial
assaults and sometimes using women as bargaining chips
in exchange for suspects (Lasky et al., 2006).
The Iraq Family Health Survey study group (IFHS) carried out on 9,345 households indicated the increase in all
causes of the death toll in women aged 15 to 59 years from
0.83/1,000 women before the invasion to 1.95/1,000 women
post-invasion during March 2003 to June 2006 (Iraq Family
Health Survey Study Group [IFHS], 2008). Burnham et al.
(2006) conducted a national cross-sectional cohort study on
12,801 individuals from randomly selected 47 clusters representing 16 Governorates between May and July 2006.
They concluded that pre-invasion mortality rates were
5.5 per 1,000 people per year (95% CI 4·3–71), compared
with 13.3 per1,000 per year (10.9–161) in the 40 months
post-invasion. The male-to-female ratio of post-invasion
deaths was 3.4:1 for all fatalities and 9.8:1 for the violent
kind. These rates were updated by the Iraq body count (IBC)
to be 77% men versus 8.7% women killed by violence during 2003 to 2013 (IBC, 2013). The Iraq Mental Health
Survey revealed a rate of (2.2%) (12.8%) of the studied
population being widowed and divorced (AlHasnawi et al.,
2009). War-related violence increased the number of widows to more than 900,000, representing 9% of the country’s
female population in 2012, for whom no shelter or employment facilities were offered (Younis, 2015). The fighting in
Iraq has generated mass population displacement, where
female-headed families were prevalent because of the loss

Younis and Khudhiar Lafta
of their men’s lives (Lafta and Al-Nuaimi, 2019; Lafta et al.,
2012). As a result of the armed conflict between the radical
Islamic militants (Al-Qaida) and the U.S. and Iraqi military
force, hundreds of civilians, including women, were killed
directly or incidentally in many regions sporadically. A massive atrocity occurred when the Islamic State in Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) multi-national guerilla seized Mosul’s control
from June 2014 to October 2016. Lafta et al. revealed the
misery of daily life for women living in Mosul under the
threat of killing, kidnapping, and the severe restrictions of
women’s freedom in the context of poverty and lack of basic
amenities, 27.6% of the city’s entire houses were massively
damaged, resulting in a new migration wave. Mortality rates
among all males were 0.71 reported deaths per 1,000 person-month and for all females, 0.50 deaths per 1,000 person-month. During the military operation, so-called Mosul’s
liberation, the mortality rates jumped to 13.36% deaths/1,000
person-month for males and 8.33% for females exceeding
those during the ISIS occupation. The authors attributed this
mass loss of lives to the extensive use of airstrikes heavy
artillery risks a comprehensive loss of life in densely populated urban, indicating that the actual rates could be much
higher because of survival bias (Lafta et al., 2018a, 2018b).
According to the Iraqi Ministry of Planning, more than
1,381,332 persons were internally displaced (IDP) comprise
35% of the general population of 2019 (COSIT, 2019).
Again the actual number could be much higher as thousands
of IDPs are too terrified to contact any government authority for registration and chose to live with their relatives or
friends. Lafta et al. (2016a) focused on the needs of 1,216
IDP families containing 3,655 children living in 45 makeshift settlements. They found that 61% of the women
reported sadness and despair, and 8.9% had panic attacks
and anxiety or depression symptoms. Suicidal thoughts
were not uncommon. The Iraq Humanitarian Profile (IHP)
2018 reported that 6.7 million persons need some form of
humanitarian assistance. IDP women and girls whose male
family member has been killed or detained during the conflict are vulnerable to sexual exploitation and other kinds of
abuse like forced and child marriages (Relief Web, 2019).

Community violence against women
Iraqi women suffer from gender-specific threats where
52% of employed women experienced some sectarian or
sexual harassment or intimidations at their workplaces or
by militias that roam the streets of Iraq's cities and increasingly control public spaces (Al-Ali, 2005). The so-called
‘honor crimes’ represent an extreme form of community
violence against women by killing the female sinner to rid
the family of the shame associated with non-marital sexual
relationships, particularly in tribal areas. It seems that the
majority of women and girls who experience community
or sexual violence do not pursue legal recourse due to their
fear of scandal and lack of a properly functioning police

3
force [Al-Ali and Pratt, 2006). As Human Rights Watch
(HRW) stated in their July 2003 report ‘Climate of Fear,’
‘insecurity affects women from accessing health care other
than medical emergencies’ (OCHA, 2008). In her study on
a sample of 500 women >18 years attending the Primary
Health Care Clinics in Mosel 2012, Al-Nuaimi (2013)
found that all of them experienced at least one type of
community violence, and 23% lost their husbands or close
family members, and 2% live in factories and schools.
Lafta et al. (2008), in their study on 1,000 women in
Baghdad and Mosel 2005/2006, found that (36.7%, 30.1%,
9.6%, and 7.6%) of them were subjected to psychological,
verbal, financial, and physical community and domestic
violence, respectively. Lafta and Falah (2019) revealed
that 65% of 323 junior doctors in Baghdad’s hospitals had
been exposed to violence with a male to female ratio
(55.1%, 44.9%). This comparable ratio signifies a risky
surrounding despite the religious and cultural traditions
that decree women’s immunity and protection. Although
exposure to physical violence was significantly associated
with the junior male gender, being a female was associated
with a higher risk of experiencing anxiety symptoms
(OR = 2,300, p < .0001). There was a significant association between exposure to any sort of violence at work
(OR = 1.976, p < .005) or outside the work (OR = 1.912,
p < .00) (Lafta et al., 2016b).

Domestic violence against women
Women worldwide are prone to different types and degrees
of domestic violence (DV) by male perpetrators: intimate
partner, husband, and close family member. This phenomenon is the supreme combination of many predisposing
factors. According to U.N. women, 37% of Arab women
have experienced some forms of violence in their lifetime.
DV is not uncommon but is underreported due to cultural
and contextual factors. Hamdan (2009) referred to the culture-related issues as risk factors in triggering mental disorders or worsening their course and outcome. In particular,
DV is positively associated with depression, anxiety, and
somatization. Women who live in conflict regions in Iraq
were subjected to DV more than others, as Al-Nuaimi
(2013) and Lafta et al. (2016a) mentioned in their studies
on women residing in Mosel and IDP women living in
slums or camps. Vilardo and Bitter (2018) reported that
21% of women (15–49 years) had a history of DV.
Moreover, the (1-WISH) reported that in 73% of DV,
the perpetrator was the husband, (53%) father, (43%) family member. Moreover, 36% of married women were
exposed to psychological abuse from their husbands; 23%
verbal, 6% physical, and 9% had humiliating sexual
behavior, etc. (UNDP, 2013). In their study on 800 women,
Al-Atrushi et al. (2013) found that 58% of them were subjected to any lifetime DV. The same study found that emotional abuse and verbal insult or intimidation comprised

4
52.6% and 40%, whereas 11.5% of the total sample has
received a threat to divorce or polygamy. The prevalence
of DV in this study was unexpectedly high, considering the
stable and secure living atmosphere. Hawcroft et al. (2019)
concluded that one in three women in Iraq experienced
lifetime emotional abuse by husbands, family members, or
law family members. They stated that the lack of gold
standard definition of DV and its categories might be overlapping with the cultural norms in Arab communities, elucidating its heinous impact on women’s mental health.

Gender disparity of mental disorders
before 2003
Gender differences in the prevalence of mental disorders
vary across age groups. During adolescence, girls are more
prone to show mood disorders and have a higher lifetime
prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts than boys
(Miranda-Mendizabal et al., 2019). In adulthood, women
had a higher prevalence of most affective disorders and
non-affective psychosis, and men had higher rates of substance abuse disorders and antisocial personality disorders. Several studies have indicated that women are
disproportionately affected by mental health problems and
that their vulnerability is closely associated with marital
status, work, and social roles. The biological differences
between men and women create mental issues related to
the reproductive stage in women’s life (Afifi, 2007).
Furthermore, the subordinate social status, domestic
violence, and lower participation in education and jobs
increase their vulnerability for mental disorders, especially
in underdeveloped countries. In Arab Muslim world countries, much literature confirmed gender disparities of mental disorders in favor of men (Okasha et al., 2012).
Browsing the search engines did not show any study of
perinatal mental disorders in Iraqi women. Younis et al.
(2019) found that psychiatric morbidity was prevalent
among 55% of the 324 pregnant women attending the
Ante-natal care clinic in Baghdad; 9.9% of them had psychological trauma, anxiety (43.7%) depression (14.6%),
and somatic (52%). Another local study showed a prevalence of postnatal depressive symptoms among 558 new
mothers in Baghdad of 33.5%. Health-related quality of
life was associated with maternal medical problems at late
pregnancy or newborns complications (Ali and Abdulla,
2014). Little is known about women’s mental health in
Iraq, particularly before 2003; however, in a study conducted on 579 college students in Baghdad and two governorates in 2001, female students showed comparable low
rates of subjective satisfaction quality of life (Younis,
2003). Al-Samarrai and Hussein (2000) reported a male to
female ratio (1:2.2) of self-poisoning in Baghdad, in the
same year and place, Younis said that 69% of females (15–
29) year old attempted suicide compared to 30% males of
the same age group (Younis, 2002). Of 1,315 attendees to

International Journal of Social Psychiatry 00(0)
a psychiatry/neurology outpatient clinic in Baghdad during 2003, anxiety and depression comprised 33.4% and
22.2% (Younis and Al-Naimy, 2006). A study on 298
patients with schizophrenia found that 54.7% of males and
48.7% had a poor prognosis. Female patients may experience specific symptoms in different presentations, and the
course and outcome of the illness can be affected by the
patient’s gender (Younis and Moselhy, 2009). Women in
the Arab world are more liable to suffer from anxiety,
depression, and somatization, which may be their main
clinical presentation (Fakhr El-Islam, 2008).

Gender disparity of mental disorders
after 2003
World Health Organization (WHO, 2006) reported that
44% of psychiatric outpatient visits are by women, and
the proportion of female users is highest in inpatient
community-based units and lower in mental hospitals
(39%, 33%, respectively). The percentage of female
patients in psychiatric units varied through the years of
the studies affected by social and security factors. In their
study on 2,979 attendees to the psychiatric clinic in
Baghdad, Younis et al. (2013) found that 37% of all
attendees were women. Regarding gender disparity, the
major depressive disorder was 25% for males, and 37%
for females, anxiety disorders (17% males and 15%
females 15%), psychotic disorders were 28% in males
and 18% in females, with an equal percentage (2%) for
bipolar disorders, alcohol. In comparison, substance
abuse was 2% in males and 0.1% in females. A comparable finding was revealed by the non-consulting population sample in (IMHS, 2006/2007), where the lifetime
prevalence of any affective disorder was 6.13% in males
and 9.3% in females, for any anxiety disorder (9.11% vs.
14.09%), and depressive disorders; males (2.12%), and
females (3.22%) (WHO, 2007).
In the years at the peak of violence, women suffered
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) more than men
(14.09% vs. 3.95%). Lafta et al. (2014) found that 17% of
1,858 male students of secondary school had symptoms of
PTSD, while Al-Jawadi and Abdul-Rahman (2007) found
that PTSD among (10–15) years old girls was significantly
higher than boys (13.8% vs. 7.8%), so as for phobic disorders (4.9% vs. 2.1%), Al-Hadethe et al. (2014) found that
the prevalence of PTSD symptoms among Iraqi 403 secondary school students (16–19 years of age) was 61% in
males and 31% in females. Kamil et al. (2014), in their
study on 450 university students in Baghdad, concluded
that the process of resilience in PTSD seems not to be
affected by gender.
The percentage of depressive disorders revealed by
(IMHS) has been updated by another national study investigating the lifetime prevalence of the major depressive
disorder among Iraqis. The male-to-female ratio was 1:2.8

Younis and Khudhiar Lafta
out of 4,332 (Al-Hamzawi et al., 2015). Women, more
than 60 years of age were also studied for mental disorders
when Ibrahim et al. (2017) found that male to female ratio
of depression was 12.7:22.5 in elderly living with their
families, while male to female ratio in elderly living in
nursing homes was 3.2:40. Another study by Al Abbudi
and Ezzat (2018) found that of the 907 elderly outpatients
in Ibn-Rushd mental hospital/Baghdad; the collective percentage of mental disorders, including dementia, was
higher in men (54.4%) than women (45.6%); this variation
is associated with biological, social, and age-related health
problems, on the other hand, Younis et al. (2020) in their
study on 300 non-psychiatric elderly patients attending
Baghdad Teaching Hospital in 2019, found a significant
association of gender with quality of life (QoL) where
45% males, and 55% females reported low level of satisfaction with QoL. Hussain (2016), in his review, concluded
that women above 60 years suffer difficulties managing
their daily life more than ever due to unstable, insecure
surrounding, 68.4% of whom were experiencing depression, 49.3% were concerned about becoming a burden on
their families, and 58.6% found it hard trying to get governmental health care.
Many women with major depressive disorders had suicidal thoughts, attempts, or completed suicide; the estimated suicidal rate of 1.7/100,000 Iraqi population is still
lower than in western countries (WHO, 2020). IMHS
results confirmed that suicidal thoughts were more common among women and girls (58.1% in males and 75.80%
in females) who suffered affective disorders during
2006/2007. Abass et al. (2018) updated the crude suicidal
rate figure to be 1.21% for males and 0.97% for females.
Although men and women seem to have comparable rates
of attempted and completed suicide, those rates are considered high for women reflecting their suffering from mental
disorders or other families/social problems. Girls and
women tend to express their psychological distress into
somatic symptoms or even self-harm. Sharquie et al.
(2015) denoted a 4.26:1, female to male ratio among
patients with psycho-cutaneous disorders. Multiple cutting, burning, and hair-pulling were commonly presented.
Regarding alcohol and substance abuse, it is believed
that women and girls are the least consumers because of
religious and social taboo; this was manifested by many
studies on different population sectors in Iraq. WHO estimated the lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorders to
be 0.66 percent for males and 0.24 for females (WHO,
2005). The IMHS reported that male to female ratio of any
substance abuse was 1.52:0.25. Okasha et al. (2012) indicated that in Arab countries, mentally ill women fear being
stigmatized more than men; therefore, they or their families chose to consult general practitioners or faith healers
(FH) rather than mental health units. This was reflected by
Baghdad’s study, which showed that males form 25.1%
and females 32.8% of 279 patients visited (F.H.) (Younis
et al., 2019).

Conclusion
To sum up the findings of relevant literature, women living
in Iraq were ahead of their counterparts in many other Arab
countries during their empowerment journey at the beginning of the 20th century. Four decades of wars, economic
sanctions, and fight against ISIS caused the loss of thousands of lives, including women, destruction of civil buildings, and a massive wave of IDPs that were unknown to
occur along with Iraq’s history. This review demonstrates
high figures of domestic violence and gender disparity in
most mental disorders in favor of men. These factors collectively affected women’s equality and empowerment
manifested by the gender inequality index (GII) value. The
Iraqi women’s grim situation needs the collaboration of
national and international bodies to help war-traumatized
women and implement culturally tailored strategies.

Limitations
This work was limited by the scarcity of updated or largescale studies about gender disparity in Iraqi women’s mental disorders. There was no adequate official data about
victimized women and war-related violence. The numerous published studies about foreign military personnel
overshadowed our targeted issues using the same keywords. There was no possible source of bias as we didn’t
analyze the results. We did only review the literature and
interpret the findings avoiding politically inclined.
