Abstract: In 2017, the Pennsylvania Pharmacists Care Network (PPCN), an enhanced pharmacy
services network, and STRAND Clinical Technologies partnered to launch a payor contract with a
Pennsylvania Medicaid Managed Care Organization for the provision of comprehensive medication
management (CMM) at PPCN pharmacies. PPCN and the Community Leadership and Innovation in
Practice Center at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy partnered to create the Quality
Engagement Team (QET), a group of student pharmacists formed with the intent to support the
initial implementation of this contract. The QET supported the pharmacies through biweekly phone
calls, which led to increased pharmacist engagement and produced impactful patient encounter
stories that were then reported back to the payor. We utilized Active Implementation Frameworks
and select implementation strategies from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change
project throughout the implementation period. The QET supported the successful implementation
of this payor contract, which saw an increase in CMM encounters completed by the pharmacists
during each month of the four-month contract period. Students, pharmacists and the payor each
derived meaningful benefits from this initiative. Student pharmacists can be a powerful asset in the
implementation of payor programs within an enhanced pharmacy services network, resulting in the
mutually beneficial and sustainable support of the network.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
The Pennsylvania Pharmacists Care Network (PPCN) is an enhanced pharmacy services network
of over 140 community pharmacies in Pennsylvania. PPCN is a local member of the national community
pharmacy enhanced services network, CPESN USA. CPESN USA is a clinically integrated network of
over 2500 community pharmacies across the United States formed to advance pharmacist-provided
care [1–4]. Clinically integrated networks (CINs) are “a collection of health care providers that
demonstrates value to the market by working together to facilitate the coordination of patient care
across conditions, providers, settings, and time to improve patient care and decrease overall healthcare
costs [1].” There are seven components to CINs: (1) structure and governance; (2) provider leadership;

(3) participation criteria; (4) performance objectives and quality improvement; (5) information
technology; (6) contracting; (7) distribution of funds [5,6]. PPCN is one of 49 local CPESN networks
nationwide with a local governance structure and leadership developed to meet the criteria of CINs.
PPCN’s mission is to enable and support the delivery of quality pharmacy care and outcomes
in collaboration with patients, practitioners and stakeholders involved in a patient’s care [7]. PPCN
recruits pharmacies that provide enhanced patient care services for their patients beyond dispensing
medications [1,8]. In 2017, PPCN partnered with the pharmacy technology solutions company STRAND
Clinical Technologies (STRAND) to utilize Strand-Rx, their community pharmacist-driven clinical
platform and documentation system that utilizes the Pharmacist eCare Plan (PeCP) [9]. The PeCP is
“an interoperable standard that allows for pharmacy technology providers to have a common method
of exchanging information related to care delivery, including patient goals, health concerns, active
medication list, drug therapy problems, laboratory results, vitals, payer information and billing for
services [10].” Strand-Rx was one of the first clinical platforms for pharmacists that facilitated the
documentation and submission of eCare plans [10,11].
In September 2017, PPCN and STRAND launched their first payor contract with a Pennsylvania
Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO), which covers three of five Pennsylvania Medicaid regions.
There were 61 independent pharmacies that self-selected to participate in this first payor contract. This
initial four-month contract period compensated community pharmacists for providing comprehensive
medication management (CMM) to Medicaid members who filled at least one medication at a PPCN
pharmacy. CMM is defined as “the standard of care that ensures each patient’s medications [...] are
individually assessed to determine that each medication is appropriate for the patient, effective for
their medical condition, safe given the comorbidities and other medications being taken, and able to be
taken by the patient as intended. CMM includes an individualized care plan that achieves the intended
goals of therapy with appropriate follow-up to determine actual patient outcomes” [12,13]. Through
the PeCP standard, the Strand-Rx platform served as a place to document patient care provided
and facilitated billing for these encounters. The contract permitted pharmacists to provide and be
compensated for CMM that encompassed one initial patient encounter and up to six follow-up patient
encounters within a calendar year for an individual patient.
There is limited evidence and guidance on how to implement a payor contract for CMM in
community pharmacies within a CIN, and in 2017, guidance was even more sparse [3,4]. Quality
assurance and improvement are critical components of implementation within a CIN. PPCN and
STRAND partnered with the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy students, faculty and staff
to pilot a student-led model to support the initial implementation of the payor contract to meet the
quality assurance and improvement needs.
1.2. Objective
The objective of this paper is to describe how a student-led Quality Engagement Team (QET)
within a school of pharmacy supported a local CPESN network during initial implementation of their
first payor contract for CMM.
2. Innovation
2.1. Formation and Structure of the QET
Faculty and staff at the Community Leadership and Innovation in Practice (CLIP) Center at
the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, in partnership with community-based practices
and partners, assist with community-based pharmacist innovations, pioneer novel approaches to
education, develop collaborative research, and implement sustainable pharmacist-provided care
models [14]. Student pharmacists are integral to these efforts and may elect to participate through
several mechanisms, including the CLIP Center Area of Concentration (ARCO). The CLIP ARCO
provides PharmD students an opportunity to participate in (1) elective coursework on advancing

Pharmacy 2020, 8, 141

outpatient pharmacist practices; (2) a community-based research course; and (3) a longitudinal research
or quality improvement project. These projects immerse students in practice transformation efforts
that provide hands-on learning opportunities to advance community pharmacy practice [14].
The University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy and PPCN have partnered since PPCN’s
inception. In 2017, the School and PPCN collaborated to create the QET. The QET was comprised
of five University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy student pharmacists who supported the initial
implementation of the payor contract for CMM. Four of these students were enrolled in the CLIP
ARCO and participated through a longitudinal quality improvement project. Independent pharmacies
participating in the payor contract for CMM were contacted by the student-led QET during the
four-month contract period for the purposes of quality improvement and to assist with the initial
implementation of the contract for CMM.
Both PPCN leadership and CLIP Center faculty and staff supervised the QET and met with
the students biweekly throughout the four-month contract period. Supervision activities included,
but were not limited to, assisting QET students with ongoing problem solving and serving as mentors
for the project. Mentors also directly assisted students with triaging pharmacists’ questions and issues
that the students were unable to resolve on their own.
2.2. QET Activities
This QET project was designated as quality improvement by the University’s institutional review
board. The QET students first contacted pharmacists from each of the participating independent
pharmacies to invite them to engage in a series of telephone-based, key informant, semi-structured
interviews. Pharmacists who agreed were then contacted biweekly via telephone over a four-month
period (September–December 2017) by an individual QET student. Students were assigned to call
the same pharmacies during the initial implementation so that they could develop a rapport with
participating pharmacists. If pharmacists were unable to be reached by telephone, they were called
again at a later time. The purpose of these calls during the initial implementation phase was to elicit
information on (1) the pharmacy teams’ experience with integrating CMM into workflow; (2) involving
members of the pharmacy team in CMM; (3) patient engagement strategies and perceptions of
the patient experience with CMM; and (4) successful local implementation strategies and desired
implementation support. A semi-structured interview guide (see Table 1) was developed using a
combination of investigator-generated questions and expert opinion from PPCN and CLIP Center
leadership. The students documented information from their phone calls through a combination
of audio-recording and transcribing the phone conversations, and writing field notes during the
phone calls.

QET students kept a record of issues that required collective troubleshooting and a list of questions
from pharmacists that required further assistance from mentors to answer. QET students, PPCN
and CLIP Center mentors worked through these issues at biweekly team meetings. This process
provided consistent and timely feedback to PPCN leadership from the pharmacists’ phone calls.
Students also sent biweekly emails to a primary contact at STRAND which outlined both pharmacist
questions and their feedback regarding the Strand-Rx platform and its use for documenting CMM.
This communication between the QET students, PPCN leadership and STRAND was critical to rapidly
solve problems for the pharmacists providing CMM. For example, within the first few weeks of the call
period, one pharmacist discovered that some of the common disease states she saw in her practice were
not included in the available list of options for health conditions within Strand-Rx. The pharmacist
reported her concerns to a QET student during one of their biweekly calls, and the student fed this
concern back to STRAND. By the time the student reconnected with the pharmacist, Strand-Rx was
updated to include the health conditions previously missing from the platform. Another example
of rapid problem-solving occurred when QET students identified that pharmacists were requesting
additional education and support on how to properly engage pediatric patients in CMM. The QET
provided this information to the PPCN leadership, which led to the accelerated formation of a pediatric
patient guide created by CLIP Center faculty and staff. The open lines of communication between
the participating pharmacists, students, STRAND and PPCN team allowed for “close-to-real-time”
solutions to daily barriers in implementation.
2.3. Utility of the QET
QET students helped pharmacies progress along the implementation continuum. The phone
conversations and pharmacists’ questions at the beginning of the four months often centered around
operations and technology, whereas towards the end of the four months, pharmacists had questions
about documentation, billing and clinical patient care needs. Pharmacist engagement and knowledge of
the program increased over time, leading to more in-depth questions, problem solving and idea sharing
with QET students. These students captured a wide range of information from the pharmacists during
the phone calls. Valuable takeaways from early adopters were disseminated to PPCN membership
during regularly scheduled conference calls and via email newsletters so that other participating
pharmacy teams could apply and adapt best practices locally.
Once CMM encounters were underway at participating pharmacies, QET students collected
patient care stories from pharmacist–patient CMM encounters during their calls. These patient
stories demonstrated the high-quality care provided by the pharmacists. For example, one patient
had not been filling her medications for several chronic conditions due to misunderstanding her
insurance coverage. The pharmacist intervened, educated the patient regarding her insurance coverage,
and filled the patient’s chronic medications. If it had not been for this intervention, the patient could
have gone months without critical medications. This and other stories helped communicate to the
payor the high-quality care provided to their members. Additionally, CLIP Center faculty and staff
matched patient encounter examples with publicly available healthcare payor cost data to determine
an estimated health plan cost savings per patient [data not shown]. These patient care stories and
projected cost savings were reported back to the payor and PPCN pharmacists as a part of a rapid
reporting mechanism and value proposition. Ultimately, the value of the patient care services provided
led to a second contract opportunity with the Medicaid MCO for continued payment for CMM by
PPCN pharmacists.
3. Implementation
3.1. Applying an Implementation Framework to the QET Project
The Active Implementation Frameworks (AIFs) are an evidence-based collection of frameworks
designed to support the successful implementation of an innovation. Historically, these frameworks

Pharmacy 2020, 8, 141

5 of 10

were used in education implementation practice and research, but more recently have been
applied to healthcare innovations [15]. The five core components of the AIFs are (1) usable
innovations, (2) implementation stages, (3) implementation drivers, (4) implementation cycles, and (5)
implementation teams [16]. The AIFs are used to guide implementation processes, and when applied
to our efforts with the QET project, they provide a helpful framework for others to replicate and adapt
this student engagement strategy to support a local CPESN network.
The implementation stages component of the AIFs is further categorized into 4 stages:
(1) exploration; (2) installation; (3) initial implementation; and (4) full implementation [16]. The work
of the QET specifically focused on support of initial implementation. Although each of these
implementation stages can happen simultaneously during the implementation of an innovation, they
provide a relatively linear description of the implementation of this payor contract for CMM [15,16].
For example, PPCN and University of Pittsburgh leadership prepared for implementation in the
exploration and installation stages by identifying a “usable innovation” (i.e., CMM), then forming
“implementation teams,” and finally recruiting and training pharmacists to provide CMM. The QET
was one implementation team that was formed just before the initial implementation stage.
The QET supported the initial implementation by utilizing the core AIF component of
“implementation cycles.” Specifically, the students engaged in rapid-cycle problem solving by facilitating
information gathering and problem solving during the early days of CMM implementation at each of
the pharmacies. Rapid-cycle problem-solving is an improvement cycle within the “Plan, Do, Study,
Act” quality improvement process, and is used to quickly solve problems that emerge during the
rollout of an innovation [17]. Structuring the work of the QET around this improvement cycle was
helpful to the QET students and the leadership team guiding them. This cyclical structure focused
student efforts and facilitated the provision of ongoing support and feedback from PPCN and CLIP
leadership to the students throughout their work. The QET students simultaneously learned about
improvement cycle theory while performing it during this “real world” experience.
Since the initial payor contract between PPCN, STRAND and the Pennsylvania Medicaid MCO in
2017, the program contract has been renewed annually, with the most recent contract period beginning
in February 2020. Efforts to reach full implementation are ongoing as new PPCN pharmacies join
the network and sign onto the contract each year. The QET is an agile implementation team that
continues to support pharmacies presently. The QET activities and structure have adapted over time
in response to implementation needs throughout subsequent contract periods in the ongoing efforts
towards sustainment.
3.2. Implementation Strategies Utilized by the QET
The implementation strategies most frequently utilized by the QET can be defined using four
standardized implementation strategy definitions, outlined in the Expert Recommendations for
Implementing Change (ERIC) project [18]. These include: (1) facilitation; (2) capture and share local
knowledge; (3) remind clinicians; and (4) purposely reexamine the implementation. The student
outreach calls to pharmacies represented the facilitation implementation strategy. This strategy
involves interactive problem solving between parties of a supportive interpersonal relationship to
address an area for improvement [18]. The earlier examples of rapid-cycle problem solving concerning
the addition of health conditions into the documentation platform and the creation of a pediatric
patient guide (see Section 2.2) highlight how the QET utilized facilitation. The QET also captured
and shared local knowledge between the pharmacies. Members of the QET collected ideas during
phone calls and directly communicated this information between the pharmacies and with PPCN
leadership. PPCN leadership would then disseminate the most useful information to the entire network.
Sharing local knowledge and learning from other pharmacies’ experiences assisted PPCN pharmacists
with developing and adapting implementation strategies for CMM within the contexts of their own
pharmacies. The QET also served to remind clinicians about CMM goals during their biweekly phone
calls. For example, if a pharmacist had not yet initiated the provision of CMM through the contract,

Pharmacy 2020, 8, 141

6 of 10

or was slow to implement CMM, then the QET member’s phone call could serve as a reminder to
begin or continue the implementation process. Lastly, the QET aided in purposely reexamining the
implementation throughout the initial implementation process by monitoring the needs, progress and
preferences of the pharmacists while initial implementation was ongoing. For example, one component
of the implementation effort was direct communication between the Executive Manager of PPCN
and the participating pharmacies. Pharmacists provided feedback to the QET that this open line of
communication was helpful to them, which supported the continuation of this practice during and
beyond initial implementation. We recommend utilizing these four implementation strategies to those
who wish to involve students in the implementation of medication management services through a
CPESN network.

5. Discussion
There is a growing body of literature on CPESN networks and the implementation of medication
management services within community pharmacies [20–27]. Though there is a growing body of
literature on these topics, to our knowledge, formally utilizing students as an implementation team
for a CPESN network is a novel approach. In this paper, we described the establishment of a student
pharmacist-led implementation team, the QET, which assisted with the initial implementation of a payor
contract for CMM in independent community pharmacies as part of a statewide CIN. The activities of
the QET included biweekly phone calls and communications with the PPCN, CLIP Center and STRAND
leadership throughout the contract period. These efforts contributed to the adoption of CMM during
the contract period, as demonstrated by the increase in the number of patient encounters completed
by participating pharmacies each month. The efforts of the QET students helped ensure the quality
of the program and created a mechanism to engage pharmacists who participated in the program.
Because this experience was built into the students’ ARCO within the PharmD curriculum, they were
motivated to complete the work. Integration into the curriculum also provided an infrastructure for
staff and faculty support of the project.
The relationships and conversations between the QET students and pharmacists fostered powerful
collaborative learning surrounding the implementation of the payor contract for CMM. Because the same
students called the same pharmacies throughout the contract period, mentoring relationships readily
formed. Pharmacists provided information to the students on best practices as well as the barriers
they faced when implementing the network contract services. PPCN and CLIP Center leadership
gathered anecdotal evidence that pharmacists felt they contributed to the students’ development as
pharmacists during this time. The patient stories the pharmacists shared with the students also became
insightful patient experiences to share back to the payor. The stories captured both the quality of
care provided and permitted cost savings estimates [data not shown]. Both of these outcomes were
important to the payor and supported justification for the renewal of the contract, which is now in its
fourth year. Utilizing a team of student pharmacists as a component of an implementation approach
proved incredibly valuable to the network. It also provided a meaningful learning experience for
the students who participated [28]. This structure kept PPCN pharmacists engaged, demonstrated
desirable outcomes to the payor, and ultimately supported the provision of CMM by PPCN pharmacists
to patients.
One limitation is that reporting on this project after initial implementation limited our ability to
collect data points that might be valuable for the replication of the project by others. For example,
we did not systematically collect time spent by students and faculty mentors on the project, which
limited our ability to report on resources that others would need to replicate the program. Additionally,
the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy had a well-established relationship with the CPESN
network, PPCN, which permitted the ease of communication between parties. This may limit
generalizability to other institutions and CPESN networks that may not have the same structure or
existing relationships.
Since its inception, the QET has sustained and adapted to meet the needs of PPCN. An increasing
number of students support a growing number of PPCN pharmacies that participate in the Medicaid
MCO contract for CMM. The QET now includes student pharmacists from the second, third and fourth
professional years of the PharmD program. As of 2018, the team is led by a CLIP Center Fellow, which
provides a community of learning experience and additional educational and leadership benefits
to post-graduate trainees [29]. The QET students now support all PPCN pharmacies regardless of
payor contract status through phone call check-ins and emails with reminders and resources related
to community practice transformation. There are now over 140 pharmacies in PPCN, 80 of which
are participating in the Medicaid MCO contract in 2020. The QET continues to collect patient stories
from PPCN pharmacists to help PPCN leadership advocate for new programs with additional payors.
Notably, nearly all of the work of the QET to-date has been done remotely. Remote support that

Pharmacy 2020, 8, 141

8 of 10

produces meaningful results and learning for students is now more relevant than ever in light of the
COVID-19 pandemic [30].
Utilizing student learners to support community pharmacies opens the door for new student
engagement opportunities in community pharmacy practice transformation. Involving student
pharmacists in practice transformation has become a national topic of conversation amidst the
recent national efforts to unite colleges/schools of pharmacy with CPESN networks for practice
transformation initiatives. For example, the Academia-CPESN Transformation (ACT) Pharmacy
Collaborative was formed in 2019 to unite the efforts and resources of CINs of community pharmacies
and colleges/schools of pharmacy [31]. The ACT Pharmacy Collaborative includes over 250 faculty
nationwide at 88 colleges/schools of pharmacy and provides a platform to further explore and discuss
how student pharmacists can support community pharmacy practice transformation. The QET project
is one example of how an individual school of pharmacy and its students worked collaboratively with
a local CPESN network.
6. Conclusions
Student pharmacists can be a powerful asset in the implementation of payor programs within
CINs of community pharmacies. The use of the AIFs and select key implementation strategies can
effectively guide and design student involvement in quality improvement work. Student engagement
in quality improvement, when supported with faculty and staff mentorship, can be instrumental in
payor contract implementation, while simultaneously supporting student learning.
