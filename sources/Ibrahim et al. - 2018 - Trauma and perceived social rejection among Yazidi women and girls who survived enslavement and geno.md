Trauma and perceived social rejection
among Yazidi women and girls who
survived enslavement and genocide
Hawkar Ibrahim1,2,3*, Verena Ertl1,3, Claudia Catani1,3, Azad Ali Ismail2 and Frank Neuner1,3

Abstract
Background: In August 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a terrorist organization, attacked the Yazidi’s
ancestral homeland in northwestern Iraq. Among other atrocities, they abducted thousands of women and girls
and traded many of them into sexual slavery. The aim of this study is to determine the mental health of women
and girl survivors of these events in relation to enslavement and experiences with genocide-related events, as well
as perceived social rejection in their community.
Methods: Between February and July 2017, trained local assessors interviewed a sample of 416 Yazidi women and
girls (65 of whom had survived sexual enslavement), aged between 17 and 75 years, and living in internally displaced
person camps in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms were
assessed using validated Kurdish versions of standard instruments. Scales for trauma exposure and perceived rejection
were developed for the purpose of this study.
Results: Participants reported a high number of traumatic events. More than 80% of girls and women, and almost all
participants who were formerly enslaved, met criteria for a probable DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis. Trauma exposure and
enslavement predicted poor mental health. In addition, among formerly enslaved girls and women, perceived social
rejection in their community mediated the relationship between traumatic enslavement events and depression
symptoms.
Conclusions: In a context of maximum adversity, enslavement and war-related events contribute to high levels of
PTSD and depression. Perceived social rejection seems to play a role in the relationship between trauma exposure and
mental health among abducted genocide survivors. Providing psychosocial support and treatment for Yazidi people is
essential and urgently required.

Background
The Yazidis (Êzidî) are a Kurdish religious minority living
in the north of Iraq, western Iran, eastern Turkey, and
northern Syria [1]. They are followers of Yazidism, a
non-Abrahamic, orally transmitted religion [2] that shares
common characteristics with Christianity, Islam, and other
monotheistic religions. Following the upheaval of the Arab
Spring movement in the Middle East, an Islamic fundamentalist militant group, the so-called Islamic State of

Iraq and Syria (ISIS), declared an Islamic Caliphate in
Syria and Iraq. In June 2014, ISIS fighters captured the
center of the Nineveh governorate in Iraq and announced
a campaign to purify their Caliphate of non-Arab and
non-Sunni Muslim communities, committing numerous
atrocities against the civilian population. Due to their ethnicity and religion, Yazidis, as a Kurdish religious minority,
were among the most severely affected communities [3].
In August 2014, ISIS attacked the Yazidi’s ancestral homeland in northwestern Iraq, close to the Iraqi–Syrian
border. During the attack, ISIS killed, kidnapped, and
enslaved thousands of children, men, women, and girls,
displacing the entire community to refugee camps in the

process [4]. Based on survey data, Cetorelli et al. [5] estimated that 3100 Yazidis were killed and 6800 were
kidnapped in this operation. The Independent International
Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic by
United Nations Human Rights Council investigated the
violations committed against Yazidis and documented that
the Yazidi people were subjected to mass killings, rape, sexual violence, enslavement, torture, and forcible transfer,
leading the it to declare ISIS’s crimes against the Yazidis as
a genocide [6].
War and atrocities in the context of genocide have negative effects for the survivors at both the individual and collective levels. Multiple types of traumatic events during
periods of genocide, including witnessing extreme violence,
the disappearance and loss of family members, rape and
sexual humiliation, torture, imprisonment, and kidnapping
[7, 8], can have psychological consequences [9–11]. Research conducted in other conflict regions, including
Rwanda [12] and Bosnia [13], has found that genocidal
atrocities bring about long-lasting and severe effects for the
survivors, with up to almost 70% of the survivors fulfilling
criteria for trauma-related disorders. Studies among
non-Yazidi Kurdish genocide survivors in the Middle East
have shown that survivors still suffer from a wide range of
mental health conditions years and even decades after the
genocide campaigns [14–17]. A few recent studies with
small- to medium-sized samples of forcibly displaced Yazidis have documented high rates of mental ill-health. Based
on clinical interviews, Tekin et al. [18] found rates of 43%
for PTSD and 40% for major depression among Yazidis displaced into Turkey. Similar levels were found for Yazidi
children in Turkey [19, 20].
Sexual violence against women has commonly been systematically used during wars and genocide, with the aim
of traumatizing the civilian population and the elimination
of the targeted group through the desecration of individual group members [21]. Systematic rape and sexual violence have devastating effects on social, psychological, and
physical health, including genital and non-genital injuries
experienced by the survivors [22, 23]. Such violence contributes to a range of psychological disorders. Clinically
significant psychological disorders have been documented
in 69.4% of survivors of war-related sexual violence in
northern Uganda. Sexual violence may occur over
extended periods of time after the abduction of girls and
women. Such extreme adversity hardly goes without
long-term harm for the survivors, with almost 85% of the
sample of abducted rape survivors from Bosnia and Congo
presenting with trauma-related disorders [24]. A recent
review of 20 studies of civilians who experienced
war-related sexual violence from six countries across
Africa and Europe concluded that the psychological
sequelae of wartime sexual violence most often included
extreme rates of PTSD, anxiety, and depression [25]. More

recently, Hoffman et al. [26] assessed the prevalence of
PTSD as well as complex PTSD among 108 female Yazidi
former ISIS captives and found that 50.9% of them had
probable complex PTSD, while 20% had probable PTSD.
The negative impacts of rape and wartime sexual violence extend into the survivors’ social lives. Victims of
wartime sexual violence are commonly faced with rejection by their community and family members [27, 28].
Sexual violence has been associated with perceived levels
of stigma and poor community relations among girls
who were abducted by a rebel army in northern Uganda
[29]. A recent study in the war region of eastern Congo
[30] documented stigmatization, rejection, and abandonment among survivors of sexual violence. More than half
of survivors of sexual violence had been told they should
leave their home because they had been raped, and the
same proportion perceived that their status in the community had decreased. More than two-thirds of survivors avoided attending church due to fear of being
stigmatized as a survivor of sexual violence.
It is likely that the psychological and social consequences of sexual violence are more than independent
outcomes that occur on different socioecological levels.
Across different conceptual and theoretical frameworks,
the association between social factors and psychological
trauma has been well documented. Social support from
the immediate environment has been identified as one
of the most consistent predictor of psychological adaptation following a wide range of traumatic event types
[31], including forced displacement [32, 33], although
causality of this relationship remains unclear [34, 35].
Consistent with research on social support, the manner
and extent to which people in the social community
acknowledge the survivor’s experiences of violence are
associated with the survivor’s well-being [36–39].
Conversely, social rejection seems to promote and maintain the symptoms of psychological disorders. A significant association between family rejection, PTSD, and
depression symptoms has been documented among
conflict-affected adult women in the eastern Congo [40].
A similar association between social discrimination and
a range of mental health problems was also found in
formerly abducted girls in northern Uganda [41].
While the negative psychosocial consequences of
war-related mass sexual violence seem obvious given the
background of current knowledge about trauma, there is
a dearth of systematic research on individuals who
experienced extreme levels of adversities during war,
including enslavement. Herein, we compared two
samples of Yazidi survivors of the ISIS atrocities in the
Middle East, one with a history of enslavement and one
without experiences of such. In this context, we aimed
to determine predictors for poor mental health, specifically seeking to investigate whether enslavement has a

Ibrahim et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:154

unique contribution to PTSD and depression symptoms
above and beyond other traumatic, war-related events.
In addition, given the observation that some of the
formerly abducted survivors reported rejection from
their own communities, we aimed to test whether perceived social rejection contributed to the maintenance of
poor mental health.

Methods
Participants

The participants consisted of 416 female Yazidi adult and
youth survivors of the civil war in Syria and northern Iraq.
A portion of them (15.6%) were survivors who had been
abducted by ISIS and kept as slaves. Their periods of abduction and enslavement ranged from 1 day to 2.5 years
(M = 9.01, SD = 9.21, in months). At the time of the interview, the age of participants ranged between 17 and
75 years (M = 31.68, SD = 12.63). The majority (78.4%)
were currently married and more than half (54.3%) were
illiterate. Only 10.4% of the married participants had no
children, while the other married participants had between 1 and 12 children (M = 3.26, SD = 3.12). While a
large majority of the participants (87.7%) had no regular
monthly income, others had monthly incomes between
70,000 and 900,000 IQD (1390 IQD = 1 €, local rate). Only
18.5% of participants reported having received any type of
psychosocial support (Table 1).
Procedures
Sampling

The sample was drawn from Yazidi women and girls residing in the Khanke and Arbat camps for internally displaced
people (IDP), located in the Dohuk and Sulaymaniyah Governorates of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Of the 436
Yazidi women and girls invited to participate in this study,
22 refused. The most commonly reported reasons for refusing were “I don’t want to talk about this experience” and “I
got tired of interviews”. The participants were selected based
on a pragmatic sampling approach. The camps were subdivided into six to seven sections by the camp administrations, and tents were chosen based on a random selection
of households by spinning a pen from the zone center.
Trained interviewers visited the household that was in a
straight line from the tip of the pen, identified the girls and
women in the household and determined their eligibility
for participation in the study. From each nuclear family, a
maximum of two women or girls of at least 17 years of age
were interviewed. All participants were interviewed individually by using a structured interview based on standardized questionnaires.
Protection and safety

All participants were informed about the availability of
no-cost mental health services inside their IDP camps.

The address cards and contact details of relevant organizations were provided to educated participants. Before the
start of data collection, we created a referral system in collaboration with local NGOs and camp administration for
those participants who wished to receive psychological help
and for those who were severely affected by displacement
and enslavement events or by family issues. In Khanke
camp, we referred our participants to the Rawshan center
of People’s Development Organization, supported by Norwegian People’s Aid. Rawshan (Rewşen) is a People’s Development Organization community center in Khanke camp
that provides services to the majority of displaced people.
Rawshan has a specific focus on women and young girls,
especially to those who suffer from mental health problems,
family, and gender-based violence. Rawshan center’s mental
health programs include psychiatric help provided by female psychiatrists, with psychotherapy and counseling provided by female psychologists trained at the BSc level.
In Arbat camp, we referred participants who needed
support to the camp hospital to receive first aid psychiatric help or to NGOs that provided mental health rehabilitation programs. The location of the participants’
tent and NGO’s waiting list were taken into consideration when referring the individual to a specific NGO.
In total, 32 participants (29 from Kahnke and 3 from
Arbat camp) were referred for psychological/psychiatric
help. Upon request of the participants, a 2-week
follow-up was conducted by the first author, with the
purpose of ensuring that the referred participants had
received adequate support.
Interviewers

The interviews were conducted by 10 trained, local female BSc-level clinical psychologists who had experience
with the displaced people living in KRI. As part of the
training, intensive theoretical and practical training
about the study instruments, mental health risk management, and diagnostic and ethical issues in mental health
research studies were provided during a 7-day workshop.
In addition, local interviewers also attended a 1-day tour
to Arbat and Khanke camps to provide relevant information about the profile of the camps and to meet the administration staff and those local and international
organizations who have psychosocial support programs
based in the camps. The interviews took place in the
participants’ tents and lasted between 60 and 90 min.
The population in the camp, particularly the illiterate
participants, expressed a strong distrust and skepticism
of any official authority figures and were not willing to
sign any document. Due to the skepticism of the population and to protect the participants, we relied on obtaining verbal rather than written informed consent through
reading standardized written consent information sheets
to the respondents. Each explicit verbal consent was

the Ethical Committee of Bielefeld University in
Germany as well as the Ethical Committee of Koya University in the KRI.
Instruments
Traumatic events

To examine general and war-related traumatic events
experienced during the war, we developed the War and

Adversity Exposure Checklist as a combination of items
that had been collected from various sources, including
existing trauma instruments, such as the War Exposure
Scale [42], Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 [43], and informal interviews with war survivors from the Syrian
and Iraqi civil war. Both the War Exposure Scale and
the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 had been previously
employed in the validation study among Kurdish and
Arab displaced populations living in the KRI [42]. The
trauma score was computed by summing the affirmative
answers to the items on the instrument. The internal

Ibrahim et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:154

consistency of the War and Adversity Exposure
Checklist, as measured by Cronbach’s alpha, was
acceptable (α = 0.77).
Enslavement trauma scale

This checklist was specifically developed for this study
to assess potentially traumatic events that occurred during enslavement. It was created on the basis of open discussions with ISIS slave survivors and key informants,
including psychological staff in the camps. The 20-item
events reflected Yazidi women’s experiences of abuse by
ISIS (e.g., forced religious conversion, being sold in ISIS
sex slave markets, and witnessing people being beheaded
or burnt to death, etc.). The checklist had a high internal
consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90).
Perceived social rejection

In order to examine the social experience of survivors within their family and social community post-enslavement, a short questionnaire of perceived social
rejection was developed based on interviews with survivors who had previously been abducted by ISIS. The
wording of existing stigma and social rejection scales were
too complex to employ them with the population included
in this study due to the high rates of illiteracy. The resulting questionnaire consisted of five questions (‘Are you
worried about not getting married or remaining married
as result of what you have experienced?’, ‘Do you feel
excluded by your family?’, ‘Do you feel excluded (or stigmatized) by members of your community?’, ‘Are you avoiding people or social situations (events) as a result of fear
of being rejected or stigmatized?’, and ‘Are you worried
about what other people think of what you have experienced?’) with responses rated on a 4-point Likert scale.
Response scores for each item ranged from 0 to 3 (Not at
all = 0, A little = 1, Quite a bit = 2, Extremely = 3). The
items of the perceived social rejection scale were factor
analyzed using maximum likelihood factoring with
oblique rotation. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of
sampling adequacy was 0.738, thus exceeding the recommended value of 0.6. Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (p < 0.0001). The analysis produced one factor
that explained 44.23% of the variance, and item loadings
on this factor ranged between 0.753 and 0.559. This questionnaire had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s
alpha = 0.79).
PTSD symptoms

We assessed PTSD symptoms with the Kurdish version
of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) [42]. The
PCL-5 [44] is a self-report measure developed on the
basis of the DSM-5 symptom criteria for PTSD, which
contains 20 items, categorized into four symptom clusters and rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with scores

Page 5 of 11

ranging from ‘Not at all’ = 0 to ‘Extremely’ = 4. For the
probable diagnosis of PTSD, the authors of the original
version suggested a cut-off score of 33 [44], while a calibration study with the Kurdish version indicated a
cut-off of 23 for the optimum fit with a diagnosis [42].
The internal consistency of the PCL-5 in the current
study (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86) was quite close to the
consistency in the validation study.
Depression symptoms

The second part of Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 [45]
was used to examine depression symptoms. This checklist had previously been used within Kurdish and Arab
populations [42]. It consists of 15 items on a 4-point
scale (‘Not at all’, ‘A little’, ‘Quite a bit’, and ‘Extremely’
rated 1 to 4, respectively). The mean scores range
between 1 and 4, where higher scores indicate higher
levels of symptoms. The internal consistency of Hopkins
Symptom Checklist-25 in the current study was high
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89).
Data analysis

The collected data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS-Mac version 25 and JMP
13). An exploratory data analysis was conducted to determine whether PTSD and depression scores were normally
distributed, in addition to visual inspection of the histograms and a Q-Q plots. Results showed that the PTSD
and depression scores were approximately normally distributed for non-enslaved, formerly enslaved, and across
groups. The same exploratory data analysis was conducted
for other variables and results showed that perceived social rejection and enslavement events were also normally
distributed (Additional file 1: Table S1). T-tests were
applied to determine group differences. Relationships
between continuous variables were tested with bivariate
Pearson correlations for normally distributed variables
(PTSD, depression, enslavement events, and perceived
social rejection), and with Spearman-rank correlations for
continuous variables with non-normal distributions (age,
education, number of children, income, number of
lifetime displacement, and trauma score); the association
between dichotomous variables and continuous variables
were tested using point-biserial correlations. A mediation
analysis was carried out based on a bootstrapping
procedure using PROCESS macro version 3.0 [46] for
SPSS to clarify the mediating role of perceived social rejection in the association between enslavement events and
mental health. The bootstrap mediation analysis is a
non-parametric method that can be applied to small and
moderate sample sizes [47], regardless of the distribution
of the sample. Direct and indirect effects of enslavement
events on symptoms of depression and PTSD were estimated using a set of ordinary least squares regressions.

Ibrahim et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:154

Standardized estimates of the resulting path coefficients, as
well as tests of significance for each path were calculated
using two regressions (one for the mediator as the outcome
and one for the chosen measure of symptoms as the outcome). We used bootstrapping based on 5000 bootstrap
samples to infer statistical significance (alpha level = 0.05).
To determine the unique effect size and statistical significance of potential predictors of PTSD and depression
symptoms we calculated linear models. Although the
intracluster correlations were generally low (PTSD symptoms intracluster correlation coefficient = 0.0053; depression symptoms intracluster correlation coefficient =
0.0054), we accounted for cluster sampling using a mixed
linear model calculated with JMP 13 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA) that provides mixed models based on the SAS
PROC MIXED procedure. Internal consistency was determined using Cronbach’s alpha.

Results
Traumatic events

Participants reported experiencing between 0 and 20 traumatic events of different types (M = 5.79, SD = 3.02). Of all
participants, 99% had experienced at least one traumatic
event; 85.1% of participants reported that they had experienced food and water deprivation, 63.7% had direct exposure to armed- and combat-related events, and half of the
participants were separated from their family members by
force. Regarding general life events during the period of
genocide, witnessing fire or explosion (43.5%), natural disaster (29.3%), and transportation accidents (26%) were

among the most common traumatic life events. Formerly
enslaved participants reported experiencing and/or witnessing a significantly higher number of traumatic events
than did non-enslaved women and girls (non-enslaved: M
= 5.79, SD = 3.02; formerly enslaved: M = 12.15, SD = 4.30;
two-tailed t test (unequal variances): t (76.07) = − 11.38, p
< .001). Furthermore, formerly enslaved participants had
also experienced a significantly higher number of general
and war-related traumatic events (war related events:
(non-enslaved: M = 3.40, SD = 2.05; formerly enslaved: M
= 7.38, SD = 2.19; two-tailed t test (equal variances): t
(414) = − 14.215, p < 0.001); general life events: (non-enslaved: M = 2.39, SD = 2.01; formerly enslaved: M = 4.76,
SD = 3.08; two-tailed t test (unequal variances): t (74.4) =
− 7.94, p < 0.001).
Enslavement events

As shown in Fig. 1, formerly enslaved participants experienced between 0 and 20 enslavement event types (M =
7.96, SD = 5.21). There was no statistically significant difference between women and girls in experiencing enslavement events (girls: M = 8.09, SD = 6.93; women: M
= 7.61, SD = 4.86; two-tailed t test (equal variances): t
(63) = − 0.276, p = 0.783). There was no statistically
significant relationship between enslavement events and
age (p > 0.05).
Mental health symptomatology

Formerly enslaved subjects reported significantly higher
levels of PTSD (M = 61.5 vs. 47.5) and depression (M =

Ibrahim et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:154

45.3 vs. 35.7) symptoms than did non-enslaved women
and girls (p < 0.001). Using cut-off scores of 33 as a preliminary cut-point score suggested for the instrument
[44], 88.9% of non-enslaved and 98.5% of formerly
enslaved participants met DSM-5 symptom criteria for
PTSD. When we used the culturally validated cut-off
score of 23 [42], we found that all formerly enslaved and
97.2% of non-enslaved participants fulfilled the DSM-5
criteria for a PTSD diagnosis.
Perceived social rejection

Formally enslaved participants reported perceived social
rejection (M = 7.04, SD = 4.93, range 0–15), with 32.3%
being worried about not getting married or continuing
in their marriage. The participants’ feeling of exclusion
by family and community members was high; 44.6% of
formerly enslaved participants felt extremely excluded by
community members. In addition, 49.2% reported extreme worry about what people thought of what they
had experienced and 40% of them reported that they
avoided people or social events as a result of fear of being rejected or stigmatized. The levels of perceived social
rejection were not correlated with participants’ level of
education, age, or enslavement duration, but there was a
significant positive relationship between perceived social
rejection and the number of experienced enslavement
events (Additional file 1: Table S2).
Associations of enslavement events, mental health, and
perceived social rejection

As Fig. 2 illustrates, after controlling for the number of
experienced traumatic events, the sum score of enslavement events was positively correlated with perceived social rejection (β = 0.669, t = 4.49, p < 0.001), PTSD (β =
0.483, t = 3.59, p < 0.001), and depression (β = 0.678, t =
5.88, p < 0.001). To examine the mediating role of perceived social rejection in this association we tested a
simple mediation effect. After cntrolling for the mediating influence of perceived social rejection, the direct

Page 7 of 11

effect of enslavement events on PTSD and depression
was reduced but remained significant. The indirect effect
was tested using a bootstrap estimation approach and
results showed that the indirect effect reached significance for depression (β = 0.194, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.37) but
not for PTSD (β = 0.117, 95% CI − 0.10 to 0.36).
Prediction of mental health symptomatology

Hierarchical linear model analyses were used to investigate potential predictors for PTSD and depression symptoms. The first model was created for the whole sample
(n = 416). In this model, we entered age, years of formal
education, marital status, individual monthly income, the
number of family members who were directly affected by
ISIS, trauma score, and enslavement as independent variables to predict PTSD and depression as dependent variables (Table 2). In addition, bivariate relationships were
analyzed using zero-order correlations. The second model
has been proposed to explain predictors of PTSD and depression among formerly enslaved participants (n = 65)
(Table 3). The normality assumption of residuals for both
models was checked using box plots and Q-Q plots, as
well as Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests.
The results showed that standardized and unstandardized
residuals of PTSD and depression scores in both models
were normally distributed (Kolmogorov–Smirnov and
Shapiro–Wilk p > 0.05).

Discussion
The current study demonstrated the psychosocial consequences of genocide and enslavement among Yazidi
women and girls living in IDP camps in KRI. Findings
suggest that high rates of mental health symptoms were
mainly predicted by the intensity of trauma exposure.
Enslavement predicted a worse outcome over and above
the effect of traumatic event types. At the same time,
our findings indicate that perceived social rejection plays
a mediating role in the relationship between trauma and
mental health.

Yazidi women who survived war atrocities represent a
highly traumatized population. Rates of trauma exposure
documented in our study are in line with numerous reports by international organizations about sexual and
gender-based crimes against Yazidi women and girls
[3, 6, 48]. It is also consistent with studies among
female survivors of other genocides and armed conflicts [49–51]. The high exposure to adversities in this
population is associated with very high rates of mental
ill-health, which confirms previous reports of excessive
rates of mental disorders in extremely traumatized war
populations [52–54]. Yazidi women and girls who survived
enslavement reported even more severe PTSD and depression symptoms. This effect remained stable after controlling
for traumatic event types experienced by the survivors.
While we are not aware of research on comparable populations reporting enslavement, studies with survivors of abduction, including victims of sex trafficking [55], child
soldiers [56, 57], and formerly abducted people [58, 59],
have confirmed the extraordinarily harmful effects of abduction. Even when considering the severity of trauma load

reported by the population, the prevalence rate of DSM-5
PTSD of approximately 90% found in this study is exceptionally high, especially when considering that a validated
instrument was utilized. Such high prevalence of
mental health disorders can be potentially attributed
to the fact that all participants were females. Studies
among genocide-affected populations showed that the
prevalence rates of PTSD and depression are more
than two times higher in women than in men [60,
61]. Moreover, subjects still lived in dependence and
insecurity in refugee camps and less than one-quarter
of the participants reported any type of professional psychosocial support. Furthermore, given that the Yazidis
have a male-dominated and community-oriented culture,
any intimate relationship outside of their social community is prohibited. Therefore, Yazidi women and
girls who have a history of enslavement, rape, and
sexual violence may find themselves isolated in the
aftermath of enslavement, and this may contribute to
severe mental health symptoms. Together, all these
factors could be a potential explanation for the high

prevalence rates of mental health disorders in this
study’s sample.
Formerly enslaved women and girls perceived diverse
levels of social rejection by their family and community
members. The same phenomenon has been found
among formerly abducted girls [62] and female victims
of war-related sexual violence [27], who were likely to
face or perceive stigma, discrimination, and social rejection. In line with research from Africa [41, 63], we found
a significant relationship between mental health disorders and post-enslavement social stressors such as
perceived stigma and social rejection. This finding is also
consistent with results from meta-analytic studies that
showed that, in general, perceived discrimination has
negative outcomes on individual well-being [64, 65]. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the relationship
between enslavement events and depression are partially
mediated by perceived social rejection, while the mediation effect for PTSD did not reach significance. The
nature of depression, associated with social conditions
and life events, in contrast to PTSD, which may be conceptualized as a disorder of memory, could explain part
of this finding.
This study has implications for the development of
psychosocial and mental health programs. The high rates
of mental health symptoms present should serve as a call
to local and international organizations for urgent
psychological intervention for Yazidi women and girls.
Moreover, organizations could consider designing some
social activity programs using the context of education
for reintegrating formally enslaved females into their
social community.
While our study is, to our knowledge, one of the first
comprehensive studies to evaluate the mental health of
Yazidi women and girls in the aftermath of genocide,
several limitations should be noted. First, although we
were careful to obtain an unbiased sample, it is impossible to evaluate to what extent the sample is representative of all female Yazidi survivors. Our sample consists
only of those Yazidi women and girls who live in IDP
camps in KRI, while some of the Yazidi survivors,
especially those who were without male protection, live
outside the camps. Further, although the majority of
formally enslaved Yazidis were children and adolescents,
we only interviewed those who were above the age of 17.
Third, the results were also limited by the cross-sectional
design, which prevents us from drawing temporal or even
causal relationships in the interplay between traumatic
events, social factors, and mental health outcomes. For example, it could be that PTSD and/or depressive symptoms
mediate the effect on trauma exposure and perceived social rejection. Further longitudinal research could provide
clarity to the links between these variables. Fourth, social
rejection has been evaluated according to participants’

Page 9 of 11

perception and, given that the majority of them are suffering from severe PTSD and depression symptoms, this
may have an impact on the manner in which they perceive
social reactions. Fifth, while participants had experienced
repeated and multiple traumatic events, the current study
only addressed PTSD, which is usually caused by a single
traumatic event limited in duration. Complex PTSD, on
the other hand, is a psychological syndrome following prolonged and multiple trauma.

Conclusion
Our results scientifically documented that Yazidi women
and girls had experienced genocide and other instances
of suppression and oppression by ISIS, with little action
from the rest of the world to support them. The present
study illustrates the devastating psychological consequences of genocide and enslavement. Our findings call
for urgent psychosocial intervention for Yazidi survivors
of genocide.
