in Schizophrenia

Objective: Although nonadherence with
the antipsychotic medication regimen is a
common barrier to the effective treatment
for schizophrenia, knowledge is limited
about how to improve medication adherence. This systematic literature review examined psychosocial interventions for improving medication adherence, focusing
on promising initiatives, reasonable standards for conducting research in this area,
and implications for clinical practice.
Method: Studies were identified by computerized searches of MEDLINE and PsychLIT for the years between 1980 and 2000
and by manual searches of relevant bibliographies and conference proceedings.
Key articles were summarized.
Results: Thirteen (33%) of 39 identified
studies reported significant intervention
effects. Although interventions and family
therapy programs relying on psychoeducation were common in clinical practice,
they were typically ineffective. Concrete
problem solving or motivational techniques were common features of success-

ful programs. Interventions targeted specifically to problems of nonadherence
were more likely to be effective (55%) than
were more broadly based treatment interventions (26%). One-half (four of eight) of
the successful interventions not specifically
focused on nonadherence involved an array of supportive and rehabilitative community-based services.
Conclusions: Psychoeducational interventions without accompanying behavioral components and supportive services
are not likely to be effective in improving
medication adherence in schizophrenia.
Models of community care such as assertive community treatment and interventions based on principles of motivational
interviewing are promising. Providing patients with concrete instructions and problem-solving strategies, such as reminders,
self-monitoring tools, cues, and reinforcements, is useful. Problems in adherence
are recurring, and booster sessions are
needed to reinforce and consolidate gains.

here is overwhelming evidence that antipsychotics
can be effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia
(1). However, the failure of many patients with schizophrenia to follow their prescribed medication regimen has
significantly undermined the promise of antipsychotic
medications. Rates of medication nonadherence among
outpatients with schizophrenia have been found to approach 50% during the first year after hospital discharge (2,
3). The actual rate of nonadherence may be even higher, as
the estimates do not account for individuals who refuse
treatment or drop out of follow-up studies. Moreover, there
is little evidence that progress has been made in increasing
adherence, despite the advent of newer antipsychotic
medications with less severe and disabling side effects (4).
Poor adherence with antipsychotic medications increases the risk of relapse. Nonadherent patients have an
average risk of relapse that is 3.7 times greater than that of
adherent patients (5). Relapse due to nonadherence may
also be more severe and dangerous. One of the more disturbing consequences of medication nonadherence is an
increased potential for assault and dangerous behaviors,
especially during periods of psychosis (5).
Am J Psychiatry 159:10, October 2002

A coherent approach for reducing nonadherence would
benefit substantially from a theoretical model that organizes existing research findings and provides guidance to
points of leverage for improving adherence. The traditional models dominant in the study of patient adherence,
such as the Health Belief Model, are typically based on a
rough cost-benefit calculus in which the patient considers
the advantages and burdens of taking medications by
weighing the probabilities of risks and benefits (6). While
these models have been useful as organizing frames, they
have had limited predictive value.
It has long been recognized that external influences
independent of patient decision making also affect adherence. The Health Belief Model attempts to take such
factors into account by considering cues to action represented, for example, by publicity affecting the illness revelations of public personalities such as Betty Ford and
Magic Johnson. Other models focus specifically on the
treatment and communication process and the extent to
which patients understand and implement the treatment
regimen (7). Still other models focus on parallel processing on the cognitive level through disease and treatment

1653

schemas and on the motivational level through emotional
response (8). These models illustrate the importance of
specific coping plans to implement intent.
It is clear that the highly rational assumptions of models
such as the Health Belief Model are not helpful in understanding and predicting adherence in schizophrenia. Although not fully formulated, patient schemas and coping
plans may offer more potential for improving adherence
in schizophrenia. It is essential to go beyond the usual individual psychological focus of these models and give attention to contextual cues and reinforcements that are
more amenable to intervention within treatment programs. The existing research literature is usually problem
driven and atheoretical and is of limited use for explicating these theoretical ideas. In our review, however, we focus not only on the individual variables but wherever possible consider the contextual factors that may impede or
encourage a higher rate of adherence.
Previous reviews have summarized and critiqued intervention efforts in the medical field, although we could find
no published reviews that focused specifically on schizophrenia (9, 10). This review 1) provides a comprehensive
summary of interventions that have sought to improve adherence to antipsychotic medications in patients with
schizophrenia, 2) assesses the quality and effectiveness of
these interventions, and 3) evaluates the state of knowledge and suggests avenues for future research.

Method
Study Selection Criteria
The review consisted of studies examining interventions to
modify medication adherence in individuals with schizophrenia. It
encompassed English-language published and unpublished studies and doctoral dissertations completed between 1980 and 2000.
In our initial selection criteria, studies chosen for this review
included those with 1) a random-assignment design comparing
two or more groups, at least one of which received psychosocial
treatment; 2) study group size of at least 10 subjects; 3) participants with a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder; and
4) a measure of antipsychotic medication adherence either as a
primary or secondary outcome variable.
While conducting the literature review we discovered several
interesting and innovative studies that did not meet all of the
aforementioned criteria. To avoid excluding these works, we
broadened our criteria. Studies were included if 1) a majority of
the participants had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 2) there
was a comparison of outcome between two or more groups, not
necessarily with a random-assignment design.

Search Strategy
PsychLIT and MEDLINE covering the years 1980 through 2000
were searched for relevant studies. Dissertations were searched
by means of Dissertation Abstracts International. Key search
words included: adherence; compliance or noncompliance;
schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or schizophreniform; neuroleptics, antipsychotics, or medication; random assignment,
controlled, or double blind; and intervention or outcome. Bibliographies from primary sources, reviews, and recent issues of established psychiatric journals, including the American Journal of
Psychiatry, Archives of General Psychiatry, Acta Psychiatrica Scan-

1654

dinavica, British Journal of Psychiatry, and Schizophrenia Bulletin
published between January 1995 and December 2000, were manually scanned for evidence of trials overlooked by the computerized search. Proceedings from recent professional meetings were
examined for posters and presentations examining adherence.
Authors of the studies included in the review were contacted for
information about unpublished data or additional studies.
Some studies conceptualized adherence as a mediating variable that might influence the relationship between the interventions and outcomes. These articles may not mention “adherence”
or the other key words in the abstract. To maximize identification
of these reports, we carefully reviewed all random-assignment
studies with a psychosocial intervention for any reference to adherence. The authors of a meta-analysis on psychosocial treatments in schizophrenia provided a list of published studies that
included adherence as an outcome (11).

Identification of Studies and Data Extraction
Three of the authors reviewed all extracted articles to ensure
that they met inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved in
regular team meetings. A total of 362 articles were obtained, of
which 288 did not address medication adherence. An additional
29 studies explored medication adherence as an outcome but
were excluded for the following reasons: six did not specify a diagnosis or had few patients with schizophrenia; nine did not include a comparison group or did not compare results between intervention groups and comparison groups; eight described the
measurement of medication adherence but did not report related
results; and six measured behaviors conceptually related to adherence, such as medication knowledge, but not actual drug intake. We identified three unpublished studies where procedures
were ongoing, but data were not available. A total of 45 articles
that represented 39 studies were included in this review.
From the selected articles, we abstracted information about the
type and duration of the intervention, the size and diagnostic composition of the study groups, method of measuring medication adherence, and adherence outcomes. Differences between intervention groups and comparison groups or among intervention groups
are indicated if they reached statistical significance (p<0.05).

Results
General Findings
Thirty-nine studies were reviewed. Twenty-three studies
met our original inclusion criteria, and 16 were identified
during the second screening phase. In the latter group
were 15 studies that included cohorts with mixed diagnoses and six studies that used quasi-experimental, nonrandom assignment.
Of the 23 studies that met our original inclusion criteria,
six (26%) demonstrated significant effects for treatment
adherence. Seven (44%) of the additional 16 studies also
demonstrated significant effects.
A majority of the studies that reported significant effects
found improved clinical outcomes in the intervention
group at follow-up (69%; N=9). This clinical advantage was
manifest in fewer psychiatric symptoms (12–17), fewer
hospitalizations (18), fewer days in the hospital (18, 19),
and prolonged or extended community tenure (20, 21).

Treatment Modalities
The studies were classified into five broad categories by
treatment modality: individual, family, group, community,
Am J Psychiatry 159:10, October 2002

ZYGMUNT, OLFSON, BOYER, ET AL.

and mixed. Mixed-modality studies include those comparing one treatment modality with another (e.g., group
versus family therapy) and those in which various modalities were integrated into one treatment program (e.g., individual sessions and family therapy).
Among the random-assignment studies (N=33), significant effects were found in two of four studies of individual
interventions, three of 12 studies of family interventions,
none of two studies of group interventions, three of six
studies of community interventions, and three of nine
studies with mixed treatment modalities. One of four
community interventions and one of two group interventions with other than random assignment reported significant effects.

Therapeutic Orientation
While many of the interventions were multifaceted,
some general classifications on the basis of therapeutic
philosophy or orientation were possible. Psychoeducational interventions focused primarily on dissemination
of knowledge about schizophrenia, treatment, and medications, without focusing on attitudinal and behavioral
change to achieve medication adherence. Group therapy
was based on the importance of peer support and shared
identification. Family interventions derived from a belief
in the family as a critical influence on the course of a patient’s illness.
Cognitive treatments targeted patients’ attitudes and
beliefs toward medication. These interventions centered
on the assumption that adherence is a coping behavior
that is heavily determined by the personal construction of
the meaning of medication and illness. Behavioral modification techniques assumed that behaviors are acquired
through learning and conditioning and can be modified
through rewards and punishment, reinforcement, provision of cues, and the promotion of self-management (22).
In such interventions, a detailed behavioral analysis of the
problem was often conducted, and treatment procedures
were targeted at specific components of the behavior.
Community programs typically involved a complex variety of supportive and rehabilitative services delivered to
clients in the community rather than in a clinic.

Specificity and Intensity of Interventions
Medication adherence was a central goal in all four
studies of individual interventions (20, 21, 23, 24), three
studies of mixed interventions (22, 25–27), and two studies
of group interventions (28, 29). The community studies
emphasized extending client tenure in the community
and improving daily function, and most of the group studies emphasized psychoeducational goals.
Interventions that made medication adherence the primary goal were more successful in increasing medication
use than those that viewed adherence as a secondary outcome. Five (56%) of nine studies that focused on adherence found significant results. By contrast, only 27% of the
Am J Psychiatry 159:10, October 2002

studies that did not specifically concentrate on adherence
found a significant change in medication adherence.
There was little relationship between the intensity of the
interventions, as measured by duration or number of sessions, and effectiveness. Some interventions that included
a relatively large number of sessions (e.g., 20 sessions [30])
or were extended in duration (e.g., 36 months [31]) were no
more effective than usual care in reducing medication
nonadherence. By contrast, some interventions that included relatively few sessions (e.g., four to six sessions [20,
21]) or were brief (e.g., 2 months [16]) were highly effective.
There was an interaction between specificity and duration. Three of the four short intervention studies that reported significant findings also had medication adherence
as a central goal of the study (20, 22, 23), while many of the
studies of longer-duration interventions did not.

Description of Interventions
Individual interventions. Four individual intervention
studies that met our inclusion criteria were found (20, 21,
23, 24, 32) (Table 1). (The two references by Kemp et al. [20,
21] describe the same study.) Of the two studies that reported significant findings, one examined motivational
interviewing, and the other compared behavioral treatment to a psychoeducational intervention and nonspecific counseling. The studies reporting positive results
both examined psychoeducational interventions.
Kemp and colleagues (20, 21) tested compliance therapy, a combination of cognitive approaches and motivational interviewing to enhance medication adherence. Intervention sessions encouraged patients to articulate their
beliefs and ambivalence about antipsychotic medications
while focusing on adaptive behaviors and the importance
of staying well. Therapists helped patients connect indirect benefits of medication, such as improved personal relations, to adherence and symptom reduction. Inpatients
who received compliance therapy demonstrated sustained gains in medication adherence over 18 months after hospital discharge and better measures of insight and
attitudes toward treatment (20).
The study by Boczkowski and colleagues (23) compared
the efficacy of behavioral training versus psychoeducation
or standard treatment. Participants who received behavioral training were more adherent at the 3-month followup than participants who received psychoeducation or
standard treatment. The authors concluded that behavioral interventions were more effective because they acted
directly on pill-taking behaviors through stimulus cues
and feedback.
Group interventions. Of the four group interventions
that met our inclusion criteria (28–30, 33), one program,
which was primarily psychoeducational but also involved
a behavioral component, was successful (Table 2). In the
study by Seltzer and co-workers (28), patients in three intervention groups received nine lectures about their disorder and its pharmacological management along with rein-

forcement for desirable medication-taking routines.
Group resources were used to help patients deal with fears
and resistance that interfere with adherence. Patients who
received the intervention were more adherent than the
comparison patients at 5-month follow-up. Substantial
loss of intervention group (28%) and comparison group
(74%) patients raises concerns of attrition bias.
Family interventions. A variety of psychoeducational,
behavioral, and problem-solving strategies have been employed to optimize families’ coping and promote better
outcomes for patients. Some interventions involve patients’ participation, while others work exclusively with
family members. Of the 12 family studies that were reviewed (12–14, 34–44), only three reported significant differences in adherence (Table 3). (The references by Strang
et al. [13] and Falloon et al. [34] describe the same study.
Two references by Leff et al. [37, 38] describe the same
study.) Two of the three successful family interventions included a behavioral component.
Falloon et al. (34) compared experimental behavioral
family therapy to individual supportive psychotherapy.
The experimental treatment was home-based and focused
on enhancing family functioning, while the individual sessions were conducted in the clinic and organized around
the needs of the individual patients. After 6 months the
family therapy group showed significantly less transition
to depot medication and better adherence with oral medication. Most patients in individual therapy took less than
one-half of their prescribed medications, while only about
one-fifth of the patients in the family-based intervention
were nonadherent (13).

1656

Xiang and colleagues (14) investigated family therapy in a
rural province of China. Families in the comparison group
were given only a prescription, while families in the intervention group were provided basic information about mental diseases, training in problem-solving skills, and strategies for medication adherence. After 4 months, almost onehalf of the patients in the intervention group were taking
medication as prescribed, compared to only about 15% of
the comparison subjects. Significantly more families in the
intervention group recognized mental disorder as an illness
and were willing to cooperate with treatment.
Razali and colleagues (12) studied the effectiveness of
behavioral family therapy modified to emphasize close
monitoring of adherence, reinforcement of the care provider’s role in supervising medication, practical information about taking medications, and respect for prevailing
cultural beliefs concerning mental illness. At follow-up,
the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater
medication adherence, measured by pill counts and interviews with care providers, than the comparison group.
Community-based interventions. Different models of
community-based care have been developed to meet the
diverse needs of persons with severe mental illnesses and to
optimize their social adjustment. Key components of community-based interventions include the provision of a
strong and supportive social network; close monitoring of
clinical status, including the medication regimen; and provision of stable housing and other supportive services (45).
Only a small proportion of studies of community care, notably those involving assertive community treatment and
intensive case management models, have included assessAm J Psychiatry 159:10, October 2002

ments of medication adherence, perhaps because of the
peripheral role of psychiatrists in these programs (46).
Most studies of assertive community treatment or intensive case management involved comparisons with less
intensive or standard models of care. Of the 10 community
studies that met our selection criteria (15, 18, 19, 47–53),
four reported that the intervention was associated with
significantly greater medication adherence than was a
comparison condition (Table 4). None of the studies included a rigorous assessment of medication adherence.
Two of the four studies demonstrating an effect (15, 18)
provided no information on their method for measuring
adherence. Sands and Cnaan (19) used medical records
and interviews with case managers to assess medication
adherence. Ford and colleagues (48) measured medication adherence at baseline and 18 months with two Likerttype response items completed by case managers.
Despite the uneven quality of research on the effects of
community care programs on medication adherence, many
programs closely monitored patients with a history of nonadherence and considered regular medication use an important treatment goal (54). The reduction in hospitalization widely associated with community models
of care may be a consequence of improved medication
adherence.
Mixed-modality interventions. Mixed-modality studies tested the efficacy of one treatment modality versus
another (e.g., group versus family therapy) and/or inAm J Psychiatry 159:10, October 2002

cluded interventions with various modalities integrated
into one treatment program (e.g., individual sessions and
family therapy). Of the nine studies of mixed modalities
that met our inclusion criteria (16, 17, 22, 25–27, 31, 55–
59), five showed positive effects, but only three of these
studies reported significance tests (Table 5). (Two references by Hogarty et al. [56, 57] describe the same study.
Two references by Hornung et al. [25, 26] and a reference
by Buchkremer et al. [27] describe the same study.)
Azrin and Teichner (22) evaluated the effectiveness of a
behavioral intervention for patients versus a combined
patient and family intervention. The two intervention
groups were taught detailed behavioral guidelines for
each step of the medication-taking sequence. In the
combined approach, family members collaborated with
patients in implementing behavioral strategies. The comparison group received an information packet describing
psychotropic medications. The intervention groups showed
significantly greater adherence than the comparison
group, although no differences were found between the
two intervention conditions and no improvements were
found in clinical symptoms.
Kelly and Scott (17) tested a combined family and individual intervention that emphasized individualized concrete behavioral “compliance plans,” with less emphasis
given to attitudes and beliefs. In the first condition, the
study staff collaborated with patients and their families in
devising an individualized behavioral plan for improving
adherence. These plans ranged in complexity from simple

Guimon and colleagues (16) studied a patient and family approach that involved group discussion of medication
attitudes and behaviors. During group sessions, patients
discussed their conflicts about taking medication, while
therapists and other group members provided suggestions addressing these conflicts. Family members participated in similar groups. Compared with a group receiving

exhibited superior medication adherence, less severe
symptoms, and more favorable attitudes toward their
medications after 12 months.

Cultural Context
Although most studies were conducted at urban mental
health centers in the United States, some variation in cultural context existed. Three studies were conducted in
China during the early 1990s (14, 43, 44). One of these
studies reported significant effects of family psychoeducation on medication adherence. During this period, only
minimal community-based mental health facilities were
available in China. Earlier research suggested that among
Chinese outpatients educational deficits about psychotropic medications are common and closely correlated with

medication nonadherence (60). These factors might have
increased the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions, beyond what would be achieved in clinical settings in the United States.
In Malaysia, where mental illness is commonly believed
to be caused by supernatural agents, counselors who were
applying the intervention were specifically instructed not to
challenge this belief while conveying a positive attitude toward antipsychotic medications and confidence in modern
treatments (12, 61). Incorporating local concepts of illness
may have helped to avoid conflict, strengthen the clinical
relationship, and promote improved management.

Methods of Defining and Assessing Adherence
Substantial variability existed across studies in the
definition and measurement of medication nonadherence.

ports with objective measures such as pill counts (12, 22,
23, 28, 34, 56, 57) or physiological data (13, 28, 29, 34). Few
community studies described the methods used to monitor or evaluate medication nonadherence.

Summary of Intervention Results
No one specific modality demonstrated overwhelming
success in improving adherence, although some modalities were represented by only a few studies. Psychoeducational interventions that did not focus on attitudinal and
behavioral change were largely unsuccessful in improving
adherence. With the exception of the study conducted in
China (14), none of the studies in which psychoeducational interventions were administered to individuals or
families found significantly altered medication adherence
(24, 32, 37–39, 41, 44). One (28) of three (28–30) studies of
psychoeducational interventions administered to patient
groups reported improved medication adherence. None of
the multimodal studies including a psychoeducational
component reported significant results (25–27, 31, 59).
Family therapy alone did not have a large effect on adherence. Of the three family studies that reported positive
effects, one took place in China and one in Malaysia. One
study showed that a behavioral intervention was not made
more effective by the addition of family therapy (22).
A number of studies that used behavioral interventions
were successful in promoting adherence (12, 17, 22, 23).
Two studies (22, 23) compared psychoeducational techniques with behavioral interventions and found the latter
to be superior in promoting adherence.
Programs that used cognitive techniques and targeted
patients’ attitudes toward medication were often effective
in improving medication adherence (16, 20, 21). In these
interventions, the patient’s desire to comply was not assumed, and a personal construction of meaning was emphasized. The work of Kemp and colleagues (20, 21) on
“compliance therapy” has provided a promising illustration of this approach.
Finally, there was modest evidence that the assertive community treatment and intensive case management models
of community care were effective in promoting medication
adherence. Four of the 10 studies of these models included
in this review reported positive results (15, 18, 19, 48).

Discussion
Important differences existed across the reviewed studies, and many of the interventions were complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to identify elements that contributed to the success or failure of interventions. The
conclusions we derived are necessarily tentative.
Our review suggests that psychoeducation for patients
with schizophrenia and their families is largely ineffective
in improving adherence with antipsychotic medications.
However, psychoeducation programs are quite variable in
their emphasis on medication treatment, making general
Am J Psychiatry 159:10, October 2002

statements difficult. Psychoeducation interventions without medication adherence as a key treatment element
were generally less likely to improve adherence.
We did not assess the effects of psychoeducation on
other important outcomes such as patient and family
knowledge about schizophrenia or its treatment. Several
interventions that were effective in reducing nonadherence included psychoeducation but also incorporated behavioral aspects of medication taking or motivational approaches that link medication adherence to personal
goals. For some patients, increasing knowledge about
their illness and about medication and its side effects may
actually be disturbing (62). In other contexts, interventions that impart information associated with a high level
of fear have been shown to reduce adherence and activate
defensive avoidance (63).
Behavioral interventions assume that adherence is
modified by frequent repetition and behavioral modeling.
Common behavioral strategies include providing patients
with detailed instructions and concrete problem-solving
strategies such as reminders, self-monitoring tools, cues,
and reinforcements. In one intervention, patients were
also taught how to negotiate treatment issues with mental
health providers (17). Similar methods have been found to
improve the management of diabetes and hypertension
(64, 65) and to reduce high-risk HIV behaviors among
adults with severe mental illness (66).
Family therapy programs were generally ineffective in
improving adherence. Those programs that incorporated
a behavioral component were somewhat more promising
(12, 34).
Interventions developed to address medication nonadherence were more likely to succeed than programs covering a wider range of problem areas. Behavioral improvement in adherence may require a more intensive and
concentrated approach than is commonly available in less
specialized interventions. In this regard, assertive community treatment may be an important exception. Medication adherence is often a key clinical goal in assertive
community treatment within a broad-based and vigorous
program to deliver relevant psychiatric and rehabilitative
services. Although the literature suggests that assertive
community treatment promotes medication adherence
(15, 18), little is known about how it achieves these effects.
Interventions specifically targeting medication nonadherence tended to select inpatients or other groups at high
risk for stopping their medications (16, 20, 21). By contrast, several studies that were not specifically focused on
medication nonadherence included patients at relatively
low risk for nonadherence. High rates of medication adherence were common in the intervention and comparison groups of the family and group studies (33, 37–39), as
programs typically require family members to be involved
in the care of their ill relatives. This requirement may make
it difficult to detect an increase in adherence. Families
who are ambivalent about antipsychotic medications or

1661

MEDICATION ADHERENCE

who initially refuse to participate in treatment may offer a
greater opportunity to observe intervention effects because patients from such families are at high risk for stopping their medications (67).
Patients with a strong history of nonadherence are underrepresented in outcome research. Because medication
nonadherence is closely associated with treatment dropout, patients who are prone to nonadherence are difficult
to recruit and retain in clinical care and research protocols. For this reason, inpatient units provide a reasonable
setting to initiate efforts to promote adherence and study
high-risk patients. Because inpatients typically assume
greater control over taking their medications after hospital
discharge, interventions should be adapted to the changing realities of medication management outside the highly
controlled hospital setting.
In the months after hospital discharge, patients are particularly vulnerable to drug default, with half of first-episode patients with psychosis discontinuing treatment during the first 6 months (3). This may be a critical period for
providing services to ensure continuity of pharmacological
treatment. Clinical experience suggests that problems with
medication adherence are recurring, making booster sessions necessary to reinforce and consolidate gains made
during short-term, more intensive interventions. Although
we found little relation between the duration of the interventions and their effectiveness, several interventions did
not extend beyond a few months. Given the long course of
recovery of symptom exacerbations in schizophrenia (68),
we recommend that clinical interventions targeting nonadherence continue for at least 18 months with quarterly
assessments to identify patient cycling and response to
treatment and to assess medication-related behaviors.
There is no generally accepted definition of medication
nonadherence in schizophrenia. Ideally, nonadherence
should be defined in a manner that is empirically informed and clinically meaningful. We suggest defining
nonadherence with oral antipsychotics as complete cessation of medication for at least 1 week (17, 67). A majority
(91%) of patients with schizophrenia who stop taking
medication for more than 1 week continue not to take
medication until they relapse (69).
Clinicians often become aware of dosage deviations
that fall short of persistent cessation. Although it is commonly assumed that patients who frequently miss doses
are at risk for subsequent relapse, the clinical significance
of dosage deviation remains unknown. A few studies in
our review used continuous subjective measures of adherence with well-defined anchor points to capture dosage
deviation. Novel techniques for measuring adherence are
being tested. For example, Cramer and Rosenheck (70)
used a microelectronic device (MEMS) (Aprex, Union City,
Calif.) to monitor adherence to antipsychotic medication.
The MEMS unit is attached to the medication bottle and
records the date and time of each bottle opening, providing close monitoring of dosage deviations. Pharma-

1662

ceutical companies have developed accurate and easy to
administer urine tests (point-of-care assays) to assess antipsychotic levels. These tests are capable of detecting
subtle changes in pill taking behavior or drug metabolism.
Despite these promising trends, most studies in our review relied on dichotomous subjective reports of pill taking to measure adherence, an approach that overestimates
adherence (5) and reduces the likelihood of detecting intervention effects. A majority (62%) of the studies in our
review that employed specific, objective measures of adherence such as pill counts and plasma levels found improved adherence in the intervention group, even when
the intervention was not specifically targeted toward adherence. Objective measures may enhance the chance of
detecting dosage deviations and subtle, but clinically relevant, differences in medication-taking behavior, but the
greater accuracy of objective measures must be weighed
against their higher cost and the risk of lowering study
participation among patients of greatest clinical interest.
With improved measurement, various common subtypes of nonadherence, such as intentional versus accidental mistakes in timing or dosing, could be defined and
these categories could be used to assign patients to appropriate interventions. Interventions that target motivation
(20, 21) may be indicated for patients who intentionally
stop taking medications, while those that emphasize reminders and behavioral reinforcements (17, 22) could be
targeted to patients with cognitive deficits.
Although the various conceptual models (6–8) provide
some guideposts for variables to be considered in future
research, further theoretical development is needed. It is
unlikely that we will learn sufficiently from research that is
simply empirically driven and that does not build on the
theoretical foundations available from varying approaches
to behavioral change. While the importance of attaining
adherence is widely recognized, it is typically seen as an individual treatment challenge rather than one that is amenable to contextual influences and various service strategies. The complexity of these influences also complicates
theory development in this area.
The development of interventions to reduce nonadherence cannot overlook the risk factors associated with this
behavior. Although knowledge about medications has not
been consistently correlated with actual medication use,
psychoeducation continues to be a cornerstone of many
adherence interventions. In addition, a poor therapeutic
alliance has been linked frequently to nonadherence;
however, this knowledge has only recently been applied to
interventions that seek to improve the therapeutic relationship and avoid confrontation (20, 21). The literature
linking medication side effects to medication nonadherence suggests that the newer atypical antipsychotic medications, which generally have milder side effects profiles,
may make adherence easier to achieve and maintain (71,
72), but nonadherence can still be substantial (73).

Our progress in understanding how to improve adherence lags well behind the striking advances in psychopharmacology. There are many shortcomings in the research, and it is apparent that no single strategy has yielded
impressive results. Greater attention must be given to this
common and often overlooked problem if we are to take
full advantage of current pharmacological therapies.
