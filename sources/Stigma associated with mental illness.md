Abstract
Background: Mental health has not had the same public profile as physical health. This has contributed to the stigma
associated with mental illness and to its treatments. Research investigating how the traditions and values amongst those
with an Arab heritage contribute to stigmatizing beliefs, attitudes or actions in the provision of mental healthcare has
not been widely reported.
Aim: To systematically review the literature and summarize the findings of studies reporting stigmatizing beliefs, actions
and attitudes toward treatment of people with mental illness in the Arab population.
Methods: PubMed, Ovid, Psycharticles and Embase were used to identify original studies of non-institutionalized Arab
adults or children reporting findings relevant to stigma toward mental illness. A manual search of the bibliography of all
selected original studies was also undertaken. Independent data extraction was performed by two reviewers, who then
met to compare data and reach consensus. Findings were classified as stigmatizing beliefs, actions or attitudes toward
mental health treatments.
Results: A total of 33 articles were retrieved for full review. Those utilizing qualitative methodology provided insight
into the many ways mental illness is viewed and defined among those with an Arab heritage. Among the studies using
quantitative methodology, most compared stigmatizing beliefs, attitudes toward mental health treatments or stigmatizing
actions among different Arab populations, some also investigated correlations between characteristics of the Arab
population tested with stigmatizing beliefs, actions and attitudes toward mental health treatments. Findings from studies
undertaken in Qatar reported greater stigmatizing beliefs, actions or attitudes toward mental health treatments among
Qatari versus non-Qatari Arabs.
Conclusion: A large diversity in the stigmatizing beliefs, actions and attitudes toward treatment of mental illness within
the Arab population were identified. The influence of cultural variations on stigma should be explored further and used
to tailor anti-stigma interventions in this population.

Introduction
Stigma, as defined by Erving Goffman’s groundbreaking
book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity
published in 1963, is the process by which the reaction of
others spoils normal identity (Goffman, 1963). Stigma is a
major cause of discrimination and exclusion, and as such,
affects people’s self-esteem, disrupts family relationships
and limits individuals’ access to employment, educational
opportunities, healthcare and housing (World Health
Organization (WHO), n.d.). In the mental health context,
public stigma occurs when members of the general public
endorse stereotypes about mental illness and act on the
basis of these stereotypes. It refers to a cluster of negative
attitudes and beliefs that motivate the general public to
fear, reject, avoid and discriminate against people with
mental illness (Corrigan & Penn, 1999).

Mental health stigma is a significant problem worldwide
as it widens the service and treatment gaps for an already
underserved population (Pescosolido, Medina, Martin &
Long, 2013). Individuals with mental illness have to cope
not only with the burden and disability associated with their
psychiatric symptoms, but also with the societal stigmatization of their illness (Rusch, Angermeyer & Corrigan, 2005).
Psychiatry, perhaps more than any other medical discipline,
is very culturally dependent. Although diseases may be the

same, the manifestations of any particular disorder vary
with the culture in which it appears. Therefore, cultural factors may shape stigmatization among different populations
(Yang, Kleinman, Link, Phelan, Lee & Good, 2007). A
recent report suggests that stigma toward people with mental illness exists to a substantial extent among Arabs in the
Middle East (Sewilam et al., 2015). In Qatar, the National
Mental Health Strategy also highlights that stigma and lack
of understanding about mental illness on the part of the
public are widening the gap in the provision of treatment
and overall mental healthcare (Qatar Ministry of Public
Health, n.d.).
A systematic review published in 2013 summarizes
numerous population-based studies that have documented
the levels of public stigma toward common mental disorders in the United States (US) (Parcesepe and Cabassa,
2013) These studies have highlighted several sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. gender, race, age, socioeconomic status) that appear to influence the public’s
recognition, causal attributions and assessment of individuals with mental illness which can lead to stigmatizing
beliefs and actions, such as discriminatory behaviors and
negative attitudes toward treatments. Such psychosocial
research of how the Arab culture, and the traditional beliefs
and values among those with an Arab heritage, contribute
to stigmatizing attitudes or actions in the provision of mental healthcare, has not been previously summarized in published research.
To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to summarize the findings of studies reporting
stigmatizing attitudes, beliefs and actions toward people
with mental illness among people of Arab heritage or culture. The evaluation of the methods used and of the quality
of these studies are likely to contribute in elucidating
important culturally relevant factors and in generating evidence-based, culturally relevant anti-stigma strategies.

Study selection
First, all titles and abstracts (if available) were screened
for relevancy and was independently performed by three
reviewers (M.A., S.S., M.Z.). All selected relevant citations were entered into an Excel database and duplicates
were removed. The full texts of all potentially relevant
articles were retrieved and, at least two authors independently performed a full review of each of the studies
selected (M.A., S.S., M.Z., D.R.) to assure they were eligible for inclusion. A manual search of the bibliography of
all selected original studies was also conducted.

Study eligibility criteria
All studies relevant to mental health stigma among Arab
heritage or culture, living in the Middle East/North Africa
(MENA) region were included. Studies undertaken in nonMENA countries were also included if they reported on
mental health stigma among populations of Arab heritage.
Conceptual or review articles were excluded, as well as
those describing, measuring or assessing a stigma-related
intervention or program. Articles not including a representative sample, focusing on non-psychiatric disorders
(e.g. developmental disorders, neurological disorders) or
not focusing on Arabs or people of Arab heritage were
excluded.

Data extraction
Two authors (S.S., and M.A.) extracted the data using a
standardized data collection tool that was created by M.Z. to
ensure the consistency of data extraction. Stigma-related
data was extracted and summarized into three broad categories by consensus of all four reviewers, as follows:
1.

Methods
Data sources and search strategy
Our aim was to find original articles about observational
studies including cohort, case–control and cross-sectional studies, reporting findings relevant to stigma
toward mental illness among non-institutionalized Arab
adults or children. Two authors (M.A., S.S.) independently searched all published literature using PubMed,
Ovid, Embase and PsychArticles databases with no
restriction to language or year of publication. The following combinations of keywords were used to guide our
search: mental illness, mental health, mental disorders,
attitudes, beliefs, stigma, public opinion and Arabs or
Arab culture or Arab heritage. The date of the last search
was 1 September 2017. A protocol was not published
before publication of this study.

2.

3.

Studies describing stigmatizing beliefs toward
people with mental illness: those that reported on
people’s perceptions of dangerousness, shame,
blame, punishment of individuals with mental illness, and causal attributions to mental illness like
religious and cultural beliefs, were also included.
Studies describing stigmatizing actions toward
people with mental illness: those that describe how
people relate with individuals with mental illness,
particularly those which reported on exclusion of
individuals in a variety of social situations (also
known as social distancing, e.g. relationships or
marriage).
Studies describing stigmatizing attitudes toward
treatments for mental illness: those that describe
various attitudes toward mental health treatments,
such as help-seeking behavior, treatment preferences and beliefs associated with psychiatric
medications.

Quality assessment

Results

The quality of the articles was assessed using the CASP
tool to assess the validity of both methodology and results
(Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP), 2013). At
least two reviewers (M.A., S.S., M.Z., D.R.) independently evaluated the articles for risk of bias. As recommended by the CASP appraisal tool, a scoring system
was not used, and an overall assessment of bias was
made. Studies at high or unclear risk of bias may have
overestimated or underestimated the results. We have
included the number of ‘yes’ criterion, ranging from 0 to
9, as a general gauge. Disagreement was adjudicated by
consensus.

As illustrated in Figure 1, the electronic database search
retrieved 3,260 citations. After initial screening of titles for
relevance and removal of duplicates, 253 articles were
selected for further abstract review. Of these, 92 were
retrieved for full text review. A total of 34 articles met the
inclusion and exclusion criteria and were deemed suitable
for data extraction (Al-Adawi et al., 2002; Al-Jumah &

non-Arab population, not written in English, full results
not available (e.g. conference abstracts only), study was on
hospitalized patients and other reasons such as study was
about comparing medications and treatments rather than
about stigmatization.
The studies described in these articles were undertaken
in 16 different countries and included views of mental
health patients (8 studies), general public (20 studies),
families of people with mental illness (3 studies), care providers (4 studies) and students (5 studies), some studies
reported on the views of more than one population-type.
Study sample sizes ranged from 10 to 2514 subjects. The
majority of articles included in this review were published
between 2005 and 2015.
The majority of the included articles (28 out of 34) utilized quantitative methodology. As summarized in Table 1,
the majority of questionnaires used in these studies were
adapted from instruments designed in non-Arab countries
(such as the US, United Kingdom or Australia), some were
translated into Arabic, and some were developed by the
authors. Only six studies utilized a qualitative methodology and one used a mixed methodology. The main information collection strategies used in these studies were
focus groups and semi-structured interviews, mostly conduced in Arabic, and some in English or in both
languages.
As illustrated in Figure 2, the majority of articles
reported at least two stigma categories while only a few
reported exclusively on stigmatizing beliefs (2 out of 34),
on stigmatizing actions (2 out of 34), or on stigmatizing
attitudes toward treatment (5 out of 34). A total of 10 articles reported on all the three types of stigma as classified
in this review.

awareness associated with mental illness among individuals of Arab heritage, and some compared these
between Arabs and non-Arab populations. Several culturally related beliefs emerged from these studies, one
of which is origin and reasons of mental illness, which
included many perceptions that mental illness originates
from evil spirit, demons, black magic or God’s punishment. Another culturally related belief to Arabs is their
negative view of mentally ill patients in which they
think they are incapable of looking after themselves,
dangerous, crazy, less intelligent and incompetent.
However, multiple factors like education, gender and
familiarity with mental illness contributed differences
in perceptions toward mental illness described in these
studies.

Stigmatizing beliefs

This literature review was conducted to summarize findings from studies among populations of Arab heritage to
inform future research and interventions to reduce stigma
in the relevant countries.

A total of 21 articles reported on stigmatizing beliefs as
assessed by evaluating the knowledge, perception and

Stigmatizing attitudes
A total of 27 articles reported on stigmatizing attitudes as
assessed by examining overall treatment seeking behaviors among individuals of Arab heritage, including attitudes toward mental health professionals as well as mental
health services overall. Some articles also assessed culturally related treatment preferences such as seeking traditional healers, referring to god through prayers or/and
reciting Quran and only eight articles assessed attitudes
toward psychiatric medications. The studies that examined
the attitudes of individuals with Arab heritage toward psychiatric medications endorsed negative attitudes such as
fear of side effect or addiction.

Stigmatizing actions
A total of 21 articles reported on stigmatizing actions such
as social distance from individuals with mental illness.
Social distance was measured through a variety of social
situations reported by individuals with Arab heritage (e.g.
unwilling to work closely with someone, to have someone
as a neighbor, to marry someone with a mental illness).
Social distance was the primary mechanism for measuring
stigmatizing actions in these studies.
In regard to the quality of the included studies, 14 were
assessed to be at low risk of bias, 19 were at moderate risk
of bias and 1 was at high risk of bias. Of the 7 qualitative
studies, 3 were judged to be highly credible, 3 were moderately credible and 1 was not credible. The remaining 27
quantitative studies, 11 were at low risk of bias and 16
were at moderate risk of bias.

Table 1. Characteristics of included studies.

There was general agreement that PWMI should not be institutionalized and only about 34% of the
relatives thought they should.
Students and public suggest that spirits cause MI. However, ~46% of the relatives think that spirits do
not cause MI.
Stigmatizing actions were generally very low (e.g. friendship with PWMI, leading a normal life,
procreating, walking freely in public, contacting PWMI).
All the Pts perceived their symptoms as caused by some supernatural power: God’s will, evil-spirits, or
sorcery. None of them made conventional medical attributions.
Higher years of study, being single and >22 years old were found to have positive attitude toward
seeking help.
Majority of the Arabs from Jordan, UAE and Israel would refer to God through prayer if they
experienced psychological problems.
Kuwaitis versus other nationalities tended to believe more in traditional healing and referral to God if
they had MI.
Palestinians and Israeli Arabs showed more sensitivity to other’s opinions regarding visiting a
psychiatrist compared to Egyptians (who scored the lowest in stigmatization) and Kuwaiti subjects.
Around 30% of Pts considered there was a need for a psychiatric service in hospital.
58.5% of Pts thought that P-Meds could cause addiction and 67.6% thought they had serious side effects.
The help of a psychiatrist to reach a final diagnosis was thought important by only 38.1% of consultees.
Respondents endorsed generally less favorable attitudes toward seeking and using formal metal health
services.
Significant feelings of shame were associated with seeking help for MI.
People who believe that PWMI are dangerous mainly have low education and have limited familiarity
with MI.
41.6 % were afraid of having a conversation with a PWMI, while 90% would be unwilling to marry a
person with MI.
More women versus men believe that MI is due to possession by evil spirits and PWMI are dangerous.
More women versus men were ashamed to mention a family member with MI and more afraid to have
a neighbor with MI.
More women vs men believe that P-Meds caused addiction and that traditional healers can treat MI.
Higher number of Qataris versus non-Qataris considered MI as a punishment from God or possession
by evil, preferred traditional healers and believed that P-Meds would cause addiction. In addition, more
than half of both Qataris and non-Qataris thought PWMI are dangerous and were ashamed of having a
family member with MI.
Psychiatric hospitals are viewed very negatively (a place for the hopeless, dangerous and out-of-control
people).
Some classified depression as sort of contagion with a hereditary nature.
70% respondents will not accept a PWMI for the role of a ‘teacher’, 54% as a family member, 33% as a
friend and 25% as a neighbor.
36.9% of parents would seek help from a psychiatrist if a member of their family exhibited any mental
health symptoms. 33.5% would consult their primary health physician, while 24.3% would turn to a
friend for help due to stigma and reluctance to acknowledge that a member of their family has an MI.
Qataris attribute MI to the devil.
Social phobias were centered around fear of scrutiny by other Qataris versus non-Qataris in social
encounters at everyday life activities.

Although the GP was identified as an important gatekeeper to mental health services by all participants,
some participants expressed that the GP did not take them seriously
Psychiatrists and psychologists were named as the last option because they thought that it was too big
of a step for an adolescent girl
Most Moroccan and Turkish participants expressed that they feared negative judgments/gossiping when
telling anyone outside of the immediate family (e.g. neighbors).
Respondents were more likely to accept distant relationships (i.e child’s school) than closer
relationships (i.e marriage partner) with MI.
Male adolescents with psychosis were viewed more favorably as potential friends for the participants’
children than were females.
Males with depression were viewed as more likely to be stigmatized if they were taking treatment.
Participants were more willing to accept a male over a female adolescent with depression in their child’s
school and as someone they might hire as an adult.

Pts with high adherence to P-Meds had significantly lower levels of concern toward them and less
harmful beliefs.
64% of the families do not give PWMI difficult or important tasks because they lack trust in them and
consider them to be handicapped. However, 64.8% said the Pts are able to work if he or she is given an
easy and stable task.
Families of PWMI described the main causes of MI to be mainly stressful life events (e.g. conflict or
bereavement), sorcery, drug use, …
Families reported feeling neglect, especially from neighbors and relatives, and reported feeling that
people were afraid of them.
Only 15% stated that they would consult a mental healthcare agency when confronted with distress.
The main reasons for their reluctance were unfamiliarity, distrust regarding the helpfulness of the
services, or the intention to solve the problems on their own.
Being Moroccan, lower educated and more recently arrived to the Netherlands all corresponded with a
more negative attitude.
The consultation of culturally based or ‘spiritual’ healers was relatively low (9.4%).

Participants believed that traditional ways to help in postpartum MI should include reciting Quran,
traditional healer, avoiding stress, support from husband and family, and only two of the participants
recognized the need for P-Meds for those with severe MI.
Majority of women, grandmother in particular, considered postnatal depression as a result of ‘evil eye’
or ‘Jinn’.
Most nurses agree that MI are genetic in origin and is a result of adverse social circumstances.
60% of mental health nurses perceived Pts with MI as being dangerous, immature, cold-hearted, harmful,
and pessimistic.
Somalia-born respondents reported more embarrassment than US-born Black and White respondents
about seeing an MH provider.
Nearly a quarter of Somalia-born respondents compared to <5% of US-born Black reported higher
stigma and embarrassment from friends if they were seeking mental healthcare.

Arab-Israeli Pts showed a two-fold delay in their initial treatment contact compared to Jewish- Israeli
as they believed that their problem is not attributed to psychiatry or will resolve by itself. In addition,
negative attitudes toward the treatment of mental disorders were higher in Arab-Israeli compared to
Jewish-Israeli.
Significant number of respondents agreed that MI is caused by genetics, substance abuse and less likely
caused by God’s punishment.
Just over half did not think that someone with a MI was capable of true friendships, marriage, or having
children.
Over half agreed that they would feel ashamed if a family member had an MI.
45% of MI Pts consulted faith healers before presenting to the psychiatric service and 33% continued
seeing them along with the psychiatrist.
Nearly two thirds of the psychotic Pts believed that paranormal phenomena (e.g. Jinn, black magic, evil
eye) caused their disorders, while only (27.0%) of the non-psychotic Pts had the same beliefs.
Participants strongly believe that seeking mental health treatment is highly stigmatizing to the individual
and family
Cultural factors (e.g. reputation, social standing) pose barriers to seeking treatment.
Poor understanding and awareness of MH within families, results in reliance on negative secondhand
information.
Female staff had significantly higher pity, sympathy and sorry toward psychiatric Pts compared to males.
Staff showed more fear and anger toward PWMI. However, the more experienced the staff the less
fearful and angry they were.
Almost 60% of Arabs agree to work or to hire a PWMI, while 26% disagreed.
Half of Arabs agreed to have a real friend who was a former mental pt, while 26.4% disagreed.
79% of Arabs disagree of keeping mental Pts permanently in an institution when their condition
improves.
Reading the Koran or Bible was the treatment most frequently indicated as being helpful by 80% of
participants, next is ‘finding new hobbies’ indicated by 76% of participants, followed by 73.3% citing
‘psychotherapy focusing on relationships with others’.
Participants who had been living in Australia for longer believed that general, psychologists, community
mental health teams and telephone counseling were perceived as more helpful compared to those
recently arrived.
Students who chose psychiatry as their preferred specialty and who had a relative with MI had better
attitude toward PWMI and psychiatry disorders than did other medical students’ specialties.
Students with both positive and negative attitude before the psychiatric round showed neutral attitude
range after the round.

Saudi unlike UK respondents said that religious assistance compared to P-Meds and psychological
therapy were the best treatment.
UK respondents were more likely to consider hallucinations to be due to stress, brain or ear damage or
negative childhood experiences while Saudi respondents were more likely to consider the hallucinations
to be due to demons’ voices, curse or magic.
UK public attitudes indicated less social rejection toward PWMI than the Saudi sample.
More than half of urban and rural population preferred psychiatric treatment for schizophrenic and
depressive Pts. While fewer percentages of participants preferred religious or traditional healing.
Almost 30% of urban and rural populations show acceptance of having a schizophrenic/depressive
Pts without a treatment living next door to their homes, this percentage increased to 50% for both
populations if the Pts received treatment.

Arabic-speaking clients refused referral to mental health rehabilitation services due to Lack of
knowledge of the service, high levels of denial of MI, mistrust of government services or due to cultural
sensitivity (i.e. mixed gender) while their families do not support attendance due to stigma and shame.

Figure 2. Studies reporting stigmatizing beliefs, actions and
attitudes.

The majority of the articles retrieved from this literature
review reported a negative portrayal of mental illness
among a variety of Arab populations, across several countries in the Middle East, which was consistent among
Arabs living in Western societies. Stigmatizing beliefs of
God’s punishment, God’s will, evil eye, demons, spirits,
paranormal phenomena, supernatural power, curse and
magic about people with mental illness were commonly
reported among the Arab populations included in these
studies, supporting existing literature that in the Middle
East, beliefs about the origins and nature of mental illness
are heavily influenced by religious teachings, cultural stereotypes and family traditions.(Dardas & Simmons, 2015;
Sewilam et al., 2015; Ciftci, 2013; Youssef, Okasha,
Hussien & El Shafei, 2005) Several of the studies included
in this review, which explored beliefs among Arabs living
in Western societies, also confirm these findings (HenningSmith et al., 2013; May et al., 2013; Ponizovsky et al.,
2007; Slewa-Younan et al., 2014; Wahass & Kent, 1997).
In contrast, stigmatizing beliefs of dangerousness, violence, criminality and perceptions of incompetency, in
relation to mental illness were more prevalent in similar
reviews investigating stigma in Western societies
(Mascayano et al., 2016; Parcesepe & Cabassa, 2013; Rao,
Feinglass & Corrigan, 2007).
In the articles included in this review, social distance
from individuals with mental illness was the most prevalent stigmatizing action reported. Mental illness was
reported as being shameful, an embarrassment, incompatible with true friendships, marriage or having children.
This appears to be pervasive among students and even
among healthcare professionals. Studies undertaken in
Western societies appear to show more commonalities
than differences when it comes to social distance associated with mental illness (Henderson et al., 2016; Rusch

9
et al., 2005; Sewilam et al., 2015; Smith & Cashwell,
2011).
The majority of included studies in this review suggest
that Arabs prefer seeking faith healers or referring to God
as a first approach to treating mental illness. Some of the
reasons for not seeking proper psychiatric services can be
linked to some of the stigmatizing beliefs or social distance reported, such as mental illness harming the family’s
reputation or feelings of shame for having mental illness in
the family (Ciftci, 2013; Dardas & Simmons, 2015;
Okasha, Karam & Okasha, 2012). It has also been reported
that traditionally strong family relationships in the Middle
East influence the type of treatment that is being sought, as
admission of a family member to a psychiatric hospital
produces a stigmatizing label not only for the patient but
for all members of the family. Some studies included in
this review also suggest such an association, Scull and colleagues (2014) reported fear of being labeled as mentally
ill as this would result in limiting marriage prospects or job
opportunities.
In general, Arabs in the studies included in this review
expressed stigmatizing attitudes toward the use of psychiatric medications. This stigmatizing attitude toward treatment can also be linked to stigmatizing beliefs that have
been reported in these studies, such as the belief that medications can lead to addiction, or due to less involvement of
a health professional in the treatment of mental illness. It is
also noteworthy that in the study by Al-Jumah and colleagues (2014), patients with higher adherence to psychotropic medications had a more positive view and less
stigmatizing beliefs associated with mental illness. These
findings suggest that endorsing a neurobiological causal
attribution of mental illness may be associated with
increased support for biologically based treatments, something that is more likely to be reported in studies carried
out in Western societies (Parcesepe & Cabassa, 2013;
Pescosolido, Perry, Martin, McLeod & Jensen, 2007).
In this literature review, only a few studies reported less
stigmatizing actions (e.g. friendship/marrying/hiring people with mental illness (Al-Adawi et al., 2002; Shurka,
1983; Younis, 1978) or reported more positive attitudes
toward seeking appropriate treatment (e.g. use of spiritual
healers was relatively low) (Knipscheer & Kleber, 2005;
Younis, 1978). Higher education, being male and more
familiarity with mental illness all contributed to a more
positive attitude toward mental illness (Al-Krenawi et al.,
2004; Ayazi et al., 2013). Further exploration into the articles reporting these positive findings suggest that mental
health education and availability of increased accessibility
of modern mental health services may be driving this
change toward seeking traditional medicine and becoming
more accepting of living among individuals with mental
illness. Similar conclusions have been reported by other
authors who conducted reviews of stigma associated with
mental illness among Arab and non-Arab populations

10
(Ciftci, 2013; Dardas & Simmons, 2015; Parcesepe &
Cabassa, 2013; Pescosolido et al., 2007; Sewilam et al.,
2015).
The rates of low risk of bias or high degree of credibility were similar between the qualitative and quantitative
data. For the quantitative data the results are likely overestimated, and the qualitative data may have missed important concepts, depending on the study design. However,
the effect of the bias is minimized in our study as the
objective was qualitative in nature, and thus may represent
a relatively accurate description of the stigma in the Arab
population. Further high-quality qualitative studies would
help elucidate different sources or examples of stigma.
A recently published study highlighted the importance
of developing culturally specific and sensitive public education campaigns to assure its effectiveness (Pawluk &
Zolezzi, 2017). As such, the results of the studies in this
review should be considered to guide the design and
implementation of campaigns to increase awareness about
mental illness and in the development of anti-stigma interventions in countries such as Qatar, which has a large proportion of Arab expatriate workers. Different interventions
to reduce public stigma toward people with severe mental
illness have been evaluated in a systematic review and
meta analysis recently published in 2018 and found that
both contact and educational interventions have small to
medium effect on reducing stigma (Morgan, Reavley,
Ross, Too & Jorm, 2018).
The World Psychiatric Association (WPA) had an antistigma initiative undertaken in both Egypt and Morocco
(Sartorius & Schulze, 2006). The interventions were done
after identifying, through surveys, significant public and
healthcare providers’ stigma toward people with mental
illness and their families. The interventions provided consisted of educational brochures, seminars and meetings
with hospitalized patients to explore the topic of stigma
and how best to fight it (Sartorius & Schulze, 2006). These
models should be taken into consideration in future iterations of anti-stigma campaigns in Qatar.
Although this review generated important findings,
some limitations in the literature review process need to be
highlighted. First, as the majority of studies found were
quantitative, data derived from questionnaires does not
allow further probing to achieve a better understanding of
the participants’ views to make causal inferences; however, the studies included still allow us to further understand the attitudes and beliefs of mental health stigmas.
The majority of articles were of medium or high risk of
bias, which likely overestimates the quantitative results
and impacts the reliability of the qualitative data.
Second, as there may have been relevant studies that
did not produce positive results, publication bias is a possibility. Twenty-five studies were conducted in the Middle
East and North Africa region and thus may limit the generalizability of select or all stigmas to other nations.

Conclusion and recommendations
Results from the various studies examined in this review
support the existing literature that mental illness is a concept deeply tied to culture. The studies discussed in this
review suggest that among individuals of Arab heritage,
stigmatizing beliefs, actions and attitudes toward treatment of mental illness are prevalent in patients, care providers and the general public.
The summary provided of the studies included in this
review can be considered as a foundation for the development of mental health awareness or anti-stigma campaigns
that reflect the unique characteristics of Arab culture and
the first step toward elucidating culturally competent
approaches to treatment. In line of what has been suggested in these studies, educational interventions should
focus on:
•• Improving the overall mental health literacy in the
general public which address the nature, natural
course and treatments available for mental illnesses,
targeting misleading associations of shame, blame,
punishment and supernatural powers, but without
undermining the positive messages of religious
teachings that instill hope regarding treatment and
prognosis.
•• Improving the social integration of people with
mental illness, focusing on increasing positive personal contact with people living with mental illness
and integrating families and religious figures as an
important resource in the development of mental
health literacy awareness campaigns and educational programs.
