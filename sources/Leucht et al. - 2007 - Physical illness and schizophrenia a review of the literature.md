Review

Physical illness and schizophrenia: a review
of the literature
Leucht S, Burkard T, Henderson J, Maj M, Sartorius N. Physical illness
and schizophrenia: a review of the literature.
Objective: The lifespan of people with schizophrenia is shortened
compared to the general population. We reviewed the literature on
comorbid physical diseases in schizophrenia to provide a basis for
initiatives to ﬁght this unacceptable situation.
Method: We searched MEDLINE (1966 – May 2006) combining the
MeSH term of schizophrenia with the 23 MeSH terms of general
physical disease categories to identify relevant epidemiological studies.
Results: A total of 44 202 abstracts were screened. People with
schizophrenia have higher prevalences of HIV infection and hepatitis,
osteoporosis, altered pain sensitivity, sexual dysfunction, obstetric
complications, cardiovascular diseases, overweight, diabetes, dental
problems, and polydipsia than the general population. Rheumatoid
arthritis and cancer may occur less frequently than in the general
population. Eighty-six per cent of the studies came from industrialized
countries limiting the generalizability of the ﬁndings.
Conclusion: The increased frequency of physical diseases in
schizophrenia might be on account of factors related to schizophrenia
and its treatment, but undoubtedly also results from the unsatisfactory
organization of health services, from the attitudes of medical doctors,
and the social stigma ascribed to the schizophrenic patients.

Summations

•
•
•

According to this review it has been known for decades that incidences physical diseases are frequent
in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, some areas such as infectious diseases have not been sufﬁciently
studied.
Psychiatrists are often not trained well enough in the detection and treatment of physical diseases.
They must be aware of the frequent medical comorbidities and should play a more active role in their
diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
Other necessary strategies include the education of patients, general practitioners and of doctors
working in other medical specialities. The access to medical care of the mentally ill also needs to be
improved, among others, by reducing the stigma associated with mental disorders.

Considerations

•
•
•

The review covered a broad area of research accordingly, focusing attention to details has not been
possible.
Despite the broad search strategy, studies not covered by MEDLINE or not indexed by the MeSH
term of schizophrenia could have been missed.
Due to considerable differences in the design and quality of the studies in assorted and diverse areas,
quantitative approaches using meta-analysis were not possible, but should be the target of future
reviews focusing.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a chronic disease that aﬄicts
approximately 1% of the population worldwide
(1). It usually aﬄicts people at a young age and,
according to a report of the World Health Organization, it is among the seven most disabling diseases
in the age group between 20 and 45, surpassing by
far diabetes, HIV or cardiovascular diseases (2).
Suicide rates of people with schizophrenia are high
(3). A number of reviews have shown that there is
an excess mortality in people with schizophrenia,
the overall mortality being twice as high as that in
the general population (4–6), so that schizophrenia
has been called a Ôlife-shortening diseaseÕ (7).
Suicide and accidents account for only a part of
this excess mortality; a substantial proportion is due
to physical illness (5). Despite this excess mortality
because of physical diseases, the somatic well being
of people with schizophrenia has been neglected for
decades. A number of reasons probably account for
this neglect, and the stigma related to psychiatric
disorders is one of them (8). For example, a recent
population wide study in Australia showed that
although people with schizophrenia suﬀer more
frequently from cardiovascular problems than the
general population, they are prescribed a heart
catheterization much less frequently than the general population (9). People with mental disorders
were also reported to be less likely to be placed on
HbA1c and cholesterol monitoring (10), to have a
retinal examination if they have diabetes (11), to be
treated for osteoporosis (12); to receive medical
visits (13, 14); and they are treated for a physical
disease only if it is life-threatening (15). Physical
comorbidities are an issue which is emerging as a
priority in the mental health ﬁeld.
Aims of the study

The aim of the current study was to support
initiatives combating this problem by carrying out
a broad review of the association between schizophrenia and physical illnesses. The rationale was
that although the excess mortality of people with
schizophrenia has been well established, no comprehensive review of the co-morbidity of schizophrenia with physical illness has been available to
date.

Material and methods
Search strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966 – last update May
2006) to ﬁnd epidemiological studies on the
318

association between physical illnesses and schizophrenia. A broad search strategy had to be used to
ensure that no physical illness had been missed.
We therefore combined the MeSH term for
schizophrenia with the 23 MeSH terms for the
general physical disease categories. We chose the
terms for general disease categories rather than
speciﬁc physical diseases, because there are so
many diseases that we could have easily missed
some. There was no language restriction, but we
did not speciﬁcally search for unpublished articles.
Evelyn Dass did a ﬁrst screening of the search
results. S. Leucht and T. Burkard checked
the selection and ordered the relevant articles, the
other authors were involved in the writing of the
manuscript. The search was complemented by
cross-referencing the identiﬁed studies and review
articles. In addition, parts of the review were sent
to experts in particular ﬁelds with the request for
information on studies that were missed by our
search (see Acknowledgements). We focused on
co-morbidity studies rather than on mortality
studies that had been well summarized in other
reviews (4–6). Given that the general quality of the
studies identiﬁed varied substantially among disease categories, we were not able to apply the same
inclusion and exclusion criteria for each disease
category. For example, while there are many high
quality population-based studies on the association between schizophrenia and cancer, the literature on bacterial infections in schizophrenia is
much more limited. In well-researched areas (such
as that of cancer), we included the high quality
studies (in particular population-based studies
with high case numbers and diagnostic validity),
whereas in areas where only very few studies were
available, studies of lower quality were also
included. A categorization by type of study population was not made. We also did not screen the
reports of clinical trials for side-eﬀects of antipsychotic drugs. Some studies contributed data to
several areas.
Results

The MEDLINE searches yielded 44 202 hits.
This article provides a brief summary of the
main ﬁndings. A detailed description of all the
ﬁndings will be included in a comprehensive
review currently in preparation as part of a series
of books covering the co-morbidity between
physical illness and various mental disorders
(16). The results of the review are presented by
disease group following the order in which the
MeSH terms of the general disease categories
were listed.

Infectious diseases (bacterial infections and mycoses: 277
MEDLINE hits, virus diseases: 448 hits, parasitic diseases:
56 hits)

Surprisingly, few epidemiological studies on the
association between schizophrenia and bacterial
infections were found. One Japanese study (17)
found a higher incidence of tuberculosis among
patients with schizophrenia compared with the
general population. A similar result was found in
a study from the United Kingdom (18), and
reports from Israel (19) and Russia (20) also
suggested elevated prevalences of bacterial infections and tuberculosis. This relative dearth of
data contrasts with the results of mortality
studies in which increased mortality due to
infectious diseases had been shown (4, 5). In
some countries (e.g. Romania) tuberculosis still
occurs so frequently that mental hospitals have
special wards for people with both tuberculosis
and schizophrenia.
Many studies on the association between schizophrenia and the human immunodeﬁciency virus
(HIV) positivity were found. Although the prevalence of HIV positivity in people with schizophrenia was generally higher than in the general
population (0.6% in the general population of
America according to a WHO statistic) (21), the
prevalence varied substantially [1.3–22.9% (22–
39)]. This variability probably reﬂects a diﬀerent
degrees of prevalence of HIV positivity in diﬀerent
parts of the world. Many studies were performed
on the East coast of the United States, which is a
high-risk area, while studies in other parts of the
world (e.g. Asia) showed lower HIV prevalence
(32, 33). Many studies included not only people
with schizophrenia, but also those with any other
severe mental disorder. When only people with the
diagnosis of schizophrenia were analyzed however
the results, as per another review, did not change
(40). A number of reasons account for the high
HIV prevalence among mentally ill people. One is
the high frequency of substance abuse in these
populations (41, 42). Other factors may be sexual
risk behaviours [e.g. lack of condom use, trading
sex for money and drugs (43) and a reduced
knowledge about HIV-related issues (44)].
Although less research on hepatitis in psychiatric
disorders has been carried out, studies from Jordan
(45), India (46), USA (36), Italy (47), Turkey (48),
and Japan (49) also showed an increased prevalence of hepatitis in people with schizophrenia
compared to the general population.
A study from Taiwan (50) found a high frequency of intestinal parasites in 464 hospitalized
psychiatric patients, although the percentage was

higher in those with other psychiatric diagnoses
(14.1%) than in those with schizophrenia (6.8%).
Studies on the association between schizophrenia and a number of other virus diseases (inﬂuenza,
herpes-simplex, rubella, measles, cytomegalovirus,
Epstein–Barr, human T-cell lymphotropic virus,
Borna virus) and the parasitic disease toxoplasma
gondii do exist, but these were mainly focused on
infections during pregnancy (because the authors
explored whether these diseases could be a risk
factor for the development of schizophrenia in the
oﬀspring rather than because of an interest in the
co-morbidity of schizophrenia and virus infections
in general).
Neoplasms (359 MEDLINE hits)

The hypothesis that people with schizophrenia
have a decreased risk of cancer was formulated for
the ﬁrst time in 1909 (Commission of Lunacy for
England and Wales) (51). A review made in 1977
already found 28 studies on this question (52).
There were a number of methodological problems,
a major one being too small sample sizes given the
relative rarity of patients having concomitantly
both schizophrenia and cancer. Therefore, a
number of population-based incidence studies in
Denmark, Japan, Hawaii, Australia, Finland,
Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom
were carried out (53–64). Note that the samples of
the studies from Denmark (53, 56, 60, 61) partly
overlapped, thus, the ﬁndings were not independent. Nevertheless, most of these studies found a
decreased cancer risk in schizophrenia and speculated on genetic factors that lead to schizophrenia
on the one hand but protect from cancer on the
other. Other hypotheses postulated that certain
antipsychotic drugs protect against tumors (65),
and that environmental factors such as frequent
hospitalizations (which include better access to
medical care and lesser exposure to urban air
pollutants) may be responsible for the low comorbidity (53, 62, 63, 66). Nevertheless, even after
100 years of research, this epidemiological puzzle
still remains unsolved. For example, in contrast to
most other reports, a large study from Finland
found an increased cancer risk of concomitant
cancers in schizophrenic patients (58). Considering
speciﬁc cancer sites, the results are also contradictory. For example, some studies showed decreased
risks of lung cancer in schizophrenia (53, 56) while
others showed increased risks (58, 62). A possible
exception is prostate cancer, which was consistently found to be rarer in schizophrenic patients
compared to the general population (57, 58, 61–64,
67, 68).

Physical illness and schizophrenia

Musculoskeletal diseases (316 MEDLINE hits)

Stomatognathic diseases (141 MEDLINE hits)

Although some studies examined only small samples (range 10–402 patients), thirteen studies published between 1980 and 2005 consistently found
decreased bone mineral density (osteoporosis) of
people with schizophrenia compared to normal
controls (69–82). One reason for this ﬁnding is that
many antipsychotic drugs increase prolactin levels.
A sedentary life style and lack of exercise on
account of decreased spontaneity and other negative symptoms frequent in schizophrenia, smoking,
alcohol and drug abuse, dietary and vitamin
deﬁciencies, decreased exposure to sunshine and
polydipsia inducing electrolyte imbalance have all
been mentioned as factors that may lead to reduced
bone mineral density [for review see (83)]. The
problems of osteoporosis in schizophrenics remain
serious although preventive measures such as
adequate diet, estrogen replacement therapy, exercise and the avoidance of prolactin-increasing
antipsychotic drugs are standardized. There is
evidence that people with schizophrenia receive
less care for their osteoporosis than age-matched
controls (12).

A number of studies highlight the poor dental
status of people with schizophrenia (93–99) which
can be the source of infections and endocarditis.
The importance of special attention to dental
problems and of empathy by dentists towards
people with schizophrenia has been stressed,
because some of them may not be able to appropriately plan and perform oral hygiene procedures
(100).
Respiratory tract diseases (335 MEDLINE hits)

Reports on tuberculosis, lung cancer, inﬂuenza,
and sleep apnea are summarized elsewhere in this
review. Filik and colleagues (101) found higher
rates of lung function impairment in people with
schizophrenia compared to a United Kingdom
national sample. Chafetz and colleagues (39)
reported chronic respiratory problems occurred
frequently in people with schizophrenia. A further
study reported increased frequencies of choking
deaths in schizophrenia that may be related to
tardive dyskinesia, tachyphagia, and abnormal
swallowing (102).

Digestive system disorders (359 MEDLINE hits)

A number of studies on the association between
schizophrenia and disorders of the digestive
system exist, but the evidence is not conclusive.
Two population-based studies found a decreased
prevalence of acute appendicitis in people with
schizophrenia (18, 84), but this ﬁnding was not
conﬁrmed by a third population-based study
from Finland (85). An early study by Hinterhuber and Hochenegg in 1975 (86) found a
decreased incidence of gastric ulcers in 668 male
patients with schizophrenia, compared to the
general population, while Hussar 1968 (87)
found a similar incidence in 1275 autopsies of
patients with schizophrenia compared to normal
controls. Stimulated by some early studies showing a high prevalence of acute intermittent
porphyria in psychiatric populations, Jara-Prado
and colleagues compared 300 psychiatric patients
with 150 control subjects but found no signiﬁcantly diﬀerent frequencies (88). A small study by
Gupta and colleagues (89) found an increased
occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome in 47
patients with schizophrenia compared to 48
matched controls. Coeliac disease has been
hypothesized to play an etiological role in the
development of schizophrenia (90), and this
hypothesis has been supported in a recent population-based study (91, 92).
320

Otolaryngological diseases (183 MEDLINE hits)

Mason and Winton (103) found that the middle ear
disease was signiﬁcantly more common in people
with schizophrenia than in other people with
psychiatric illness. There is also a large body of
early literature on vestibular response abnormalities as an explanation for schizophrenia [for review
see Levy et al. (104)] and on the association
between deafness and schizophrenia [for review
see Cooper (105)]. The hypothesis was that predisposed individuals with hearing impairment may
misperceive auditory stimuli and may therefore
develop inappropriate associations. This assumption found support in a study of a large cohort of
50 000 male Swedish conscripts. In a link of
medical examinations of these conscripts with a
Swedish National Register of psychosis care, the
proportion of schizophrenia among those with
severe hearing loss was signiﬁcantly higher by a
factor of 1.8 (106).
Diseases of the nervous system (15 170 MEDLINE hits)

Many among the large number of abstracts dealt
with the neurological side eﬀects of antipsychotic
drugs (dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome) rather
than with the co-morbidity between neurological

16000447, 2007, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01095.x by Iraq Hinari NPL, Wiley Online Library on [13/02/2026].

Leucht et al.

diseases and schizophrenia. The prevalence of
acute extrapyramidal symptoms spans a wide
range of 2–90% (107), depending on patient
characteristics (e.g. older patients are at increased
risk), phase of treatment (early or late in treatment), antipsychotic drugs and dosage used
[second generation antipsychotic drugs and lowpotency conventional antipsychotics have a lower
propensity than high-potency conventional antipsychotics (108, 109)] and the assessment instrument applied. The most serious long-term
extrapyramidal side-eﬀect of antipsychotic medications is tardive dyskinesia. Its annual cumulative
incidence rates are around 3–5% in young adults
treated with conventional antipsychotic drugs and
reaches 20–25% after 5 years (110). The 1-year
incidence under treatment with second generation
antipsychotics appears to be lower (111).
Of note is the well established ﬁnding that people
with schizophrenia, who have never been treated
with antipsychotic drugs, often show motor symptoms (112, 113). In a review of 14 studies, Fenton
estimated a prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesia
of 4% in ﬁrst-episode patients, 12% for patients
who were ill for several years but below age 30,
25% for those between 30 and 50 years of age and
40% for those aged 60 years or older (113).
Epilepsy can clearly be associated with schizophrenia-like symptoms [for review see (114, 115)],
but there is only very limited evidence on the
inverse direction, i.e. how many people with
schizophrenia suﬀer from epilepsy (18, 116).
Whether schizophrenia is associated with an
increased risk of developing AlzheimerÕs disease
(AD) is currently unclear. Prohovnik and colleagues (117) found an increased proportion of
histological changes typical for AD in people with
schizophrenia, while a small-sized study by
Murphy and colleagues (118) (51 patients over
55 years) did not ﬁnd this diﬀerence to be significant.
There is a quite extensive literature on reduced
pain sensitivity in people with schizophrenia, which
had already been described by Kraepelin (119,
120). The data are convincing (120), although two
reviews pointed out that pain perception is altered
rather than reduced in schizophrenia (121, 122).
This ﬁnding is very important, because it may
explain in part the excess rates of physical illness in
people with schizophrenia: due to decreased or
altered pain perception, people with schizophrenia
may fail to seek the help of a doctor.
A number of studies examined the association
between schizophrenia and myasthenia gravis
(123), metachromatic leukodystrophy (124) and
homocystinuria (125, 126), but none of these

studies are, by any measure, conclusive. Even less
so are two studies that reported a similar geographical distribution pattern of multiple sclerosis
and schizophrenia (127, 128). Given the high
frequency of obesity in people with schizophrenia,
the study by Winkelman (129) is important because
it found high a prevalence of obstructive sleep
apnea, for which the most important risk factor is
obesity.
Eye diseases (267 MEDLINE hits)

With the exception of reports on ocular side eﬀects
[e.g. hyperpigmentation of the lens or cataracts
(130)] of some phenothiazine antipsychotic drugs
and the well-known phenomenon of altered rapid
eye movements in schizophrenia that is mainly
interesting as a diagnostic sign, no relevant reports
on co-morbidity were found.
Urological and male genital diseases (363 MEDLINE hits) and
female genital diseases and pregnancy complications (554
MEDLINE hits)

Many new and old antipsychotic drugs increase
prolactin levels via antagonism of the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic system. Therefore
many patients suﬀer from prolactin-associated
eﬀects such as galactorrhea (131), and amenorrhea
(132). There are also a number of relatively large
studies that showed sexual dysfunction to be more
frequent in people with schizophrenia compared to
normal controls (133–135). Increased prevalence of
incontinence in people with schizophrenia have
also been reported (136, 137). Population-based
studies on prostate cancer consistently found
reduced incidences in people with schizophrenia
(57, 58, 61–64, 68), please note again that the
samples in the Danish studies partly overlapped
(61, 68). One explanation may be the antiproliferative activity of some antipsychotics (68). Results
of population-based studies on breast cancer,
cancers of cervix, uteri, corpus uteri and ovary
were inconsistent.
There is an extensive literature beginning in 1935
(138–162, 162–169), including three recent population-based studies (165, 166, 168), that demonstrates increased occurrence of obstetric
complications among mothers with schizophrenia.
Pregnancies and births of mothers with schizophrenia are often linked with a variety of psychological, social and behavioural problems. The
situation may be aggravated by high rates of
smoking, the use of illicit drugs and alcohol
and the intake of antipsychotic medication. Low
socio-economic status of pregnant women with

Physical illness and schizophrenia

schizophrenia may also play a role in the occurrence of these problems [for review see (170)].
Cardiovascular disease (568 MEDLINE hits)

Mortality studies have shown consistently that
people with schizophrenia die more frequently
from cardiovascular diseases and experience
sudden death than control populations (6, 171,
172). We included studies on cardiovascular comorbidity, which as a minimum criterion used a
control group (9, 59, 173–190). Overall, these
studies, some of which were population-based,
showed that cardiovascular problems are more
frequent among people with schizophrenia than in
control populations, although in terms of speciﬁc
disorders the overall picture was heterogeneous.
For example, some studies found hypertension to
be less frequent in people with schizophrenia (173,
176, 178, 191), a ﬁnding that could perhaps be
explained by the blood-pressure-lowering eﬀects of
some antipsychotic drugs. The high rates of
smoking (192), obesity (193), diabetes (194), dyslipidemia (195), lack of exercise (196) often seen in
schizophrenia as well as cardiac side eﬀects of
antipsychotic drugs probably account for this
excessive comorbidity. It is probably also on
account of lesser care that people with schizophrenia receive when physically ill. An Australian
study, for example, found that people with schizophrenia receive revascularization procedures much
more rarely than the general population (9).
Hemic and lymphatic diseases (397 MEDLINE hits)

Hatta and colleagues (197) examined 259 patients
with schizophrenia on emergency admission and
found dehydration in 6.9%, hypokalemia and
leukocytosis in one-third and elevated muscle
enzymes in two-thirds of the patients. They
emphasized the importance of laboratory screenings of patients admitted with acute schizophrenia.
Skin and connective tissue diseases (392 MEDLINE hits)

Another, as yet unexplained, ﬁnding is the reduced
occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis in people with
schizophrenia, ﬁrst reported as early as 1936 by
Nissen and Spencer (198). Numerous studies
including several tens of thousands of patients
were identiﬁed (7, 18, 85, 198–211), the vast
majority of which found a decreased frequency of
rheumatoid arthritis among people with schizophrenia. Explanations may be of a genetic, environmental (institutionalization and sedentary
lifestyle due to negative symptoms), pharmacolog322

ical (analgesic and anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects of
antipsychotic drugs) and biochemical (histo-imcompatibility factors) nature [for review see (212,
213)]. Nevertheless there are also possible confounders. Some of the (earlier) studies did not
control for age, gender and antipsychotic medication or did not use appropriate diagnostic criteria
for the two diseases. Only a few population-based
studies are available and most studies were carried
out on hospitalized patients, and accordingly the
eﬀects of long-term institutionalization can not be
ruled out. The simplest bias may be underreporting
of rheumatoid arthritis by patients with schizophrenia. In an elegant population-based study,
Mors and colleagues conﬁrmed the decreased
frequency of rheumatoid arthritis in schizophrenia
(209). However, osteoarthritis and unspeciﬁc back
pain were also decreased, although the latter are
not known to be associated with genetic factors.
The reduced rates of rheumatoid arthritis may thus
also be due to a tendency of people with schizophrenia not to report pain (see above).
The remainder of the relevant articles consisted
of inconclusive reports on allergic skin reactions
(214, 215), antipsychotic-induced skin pigmentation [e.g. (216)], lupus erythematosus (217),
tuberous sclerosis (218) and pellagra (219, 220).
Nutritional and metabolic diseases (MEDLINE 1234 hits)

The introduction of the so-called ÔatypicalÕ antipsychotic drugs has stimulated a heated debate in
this area. The numerous studies on the diﬀerences
of the eﬀects of these new antipsychotic drugs on
weight gain and associated problems such as
diabetes go beyond the scope of our review, but a
landmark meta-analysis clearly showed that olanzapine and clozapine lead to most weight gain
(221). There are also many truly epidemiological
studies comparing people with schizophrenia and
healthy controls (39, 101, 129, 182, 185, 186, 188–
191, 193–195, 222–249). The methodological quality of the reports varied largely and only a few
studies were population-based. Most of these
studies focused on diabetes; overweight was often
used as a secondary measure, whereas only a few
studies assessed metabolic syndrome. There are a
few studies of patients who did not receive
antipsychotic medications, suggesting that schizophrenia itself is associated with altered glucose
metabolism, but these studies were too small to be
anything but hypothesis generating (232, 238).
Other more plausible reasons for increased obesity
and diabetes in patients with schizophrenia are
lifestyle factors [self neglect, smoking, negative
symptoms, lack of exercise, poor diet (196, 235)]

Leucht et al.

that should be considered in addition to exploring
the weight inducing eﬀects of some antipsychotics
(221). The obesity problem is one of the most
serious comorbidities due to the fatal long-term
cardiovascular consequences.
We also found 14 studies that reported high rates
of polydipsia in schizophrenia (250–263). In
extreme cases people with schizophrenia drink
15 l of water and beverages per day and the
consequence can be water intoxication with hyponatremia that can cause neurological symptoms
such as nausea, vomiting, delirium, ataxia, seizures, coma, and even death (264). Chronic water
intoxication can also lead to physical complications such as osteoporosis and dilatation of urinary
tracts, but cases of cardiac failure, hypertension,
and malnutrition have also been reported (265). On
account of the diﬀerences in populations, deﬁnitions and designs, the prevalence of water intoxication varied substantially in the studies (0–80%).
In a review, de Leon and colleagues (265) suggested
that at least 5% of chronic inpatients develop the
disorder. In summary, polydipsia is an underrecognized but relatively frequent problem in
schizophrenia. What is less clear is how often it
leads to clinically signiﬁcant consequences.
Two preliminary studies suggested increased
rates of GilbertÕs syndrome (idiopathic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) in schizophrenia (266,
267).
Endocrine diseases (680 MEDLINE hits)

In addition to papers on diabetes mentioned
above, we found reports on studies on thyroid
abnormalities in schizophrenia. There is a large
spectrum of thyroid function test abnormalities in
schizophrenia and in psychiatric patients in general
(268–280), although these abnormalities seem to be
transient and cases of clinically manifest thyroid
disease are rare. Neither the reasons for this
association nor its clinical relevance are clear.
However, since both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause a number of psychiatric
symptoms, a screening test for thyroid function at
admission should be part of any baseline work on
newly admitted patients.
Immune system diseases (630 MEDLINE hits); animal diseases
(439 MEDLINE hits); congenital, hereditary, and neonatal diseases
and abnormalities (1042 MEDLINE hits); environmental system
disorders (5385 MEDLINE hits), and pathological signs and
conditions (14 607 MEDLINE hits)

A number of reports identiﬁed in ÔImmune System
DiseasesÕ, ÔAnimal DiseasesÕ and ÔCongenital,

Hereditary, and Neonatal Diseases and AbnormalitiesÕ were reviewed elsewhere in this review.
ÔEnvironmental System DisordersÕ and ÔPathological signs and conditionsÕ are supplemental categories. Some relevant reports were reviewed in more
speciﬁc sections above.
Discussion

This review shows that there are a number of
physical diseases the incidences of which are more
frequent in people with schizophrenia than in the
normal population. A summary of these conditions
is provided in Table 1. While some areas have
been studied extensively (e.g. the co-morbidity of
neoplasms and schizophrenia), other areas are
under-researched (e.g. infectious diseases, with
the exception of HIV positivity). In spite of the
signiﬁcant amount of research that has been done,
neither the health systems nor individual physicians have undertaken consistent measures to deal
adequately with these problems in people with
schizophrenia and other mental disorders. In
developing countries the problem may be even
more dramatic. Most studies (86%) included in the
review came from North America, Europe, and
Australia (see Fig. 1). Only one study originated
from Latin America and two from Africa,
although given the limited health care available in
these countries, the actual rates of some co-morbid
conditions are probably much higher than in the
developed world. The issue of which of the physical
diseases contribute most to excess mortality can
also vary between countries. According to Harris
and Barrowclough (4) the highest standardized
mortality rates in schizophrenia were found for
infectious diseases followed by respiratory diseases,
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In some
countries, excessive number of deaths may indeed
be due to infectious diseases, but in the industrialized world, the leading cause of death in the
general population is cardiovascular disease.
Therefore, although the standardized mortality
rate of cardiovascular disease is not the highest
one, the largest single cause of death in schizophrenia in the latter countries could also be
cardiovascular disease (281).
This review has limitations. We reviewed 44 202
abstracts using a very broad search strategy that
combined the MeSH term for schizophrenia with
the MeSH terms of all general disease categories
for physical illnesses. This was necessary because
there are so many diﬀerent physical diseases that
we might easily have missed, by looking at
individual diseases rather than at broad disease
categories. Although, in theory, all studies should

have been covered by this strategy, this was not
necessarily the case because it is possible that the
MeSH coding of the papers was imperfect. It is
also clear that due to the broad approach we could
not pay attention to detail in speciﬁc areas. This
manuscript is ÔonlyÕ an overview, but we think that
it can serve as a basis of research in this area.
324

We analyzed only reports that are contained in
MEDLINE, which goes back only to 1966 and
does not cover all journals. Some studies looked at
serious mental diseases overall rather than specifically at schizophrenia and may have been missed
by our search. We might have identiﬁed more
studies using additional search terms such as
ÔpsychosisÕ, but it would have been very diﬃcult
to cover the already now huge number of hits. On
the other hand, our search strategy based on
MeSH terms included studies that did not use
standardized criteria to diagnose schizophrenia.
We hope that some of these imperfections have
been attenuated by cross-referencing identiﬁed
studies and review articles and by asking a
number of experts about missing studies.
Another limitation is that due to the heterogeneity of the quality and methods applied in the
diﬀerent areas, we found it impossible to apply the
same inclusion criteria for each category. Some of
the areas such as the occurrence of neoplasms in
people with schizophrenia have been very well
studied, so that we were able to focus on population-based studies. In other areas only a few studies
were available, and we included them despite
methodological imperfections, also in order to
highlight the need for further studies. For the
same reason, it was impossible to combine the
studies in a meta-analysis. It was also diﬃcult to
diﬀerentiate between simple side-eﬀects of antipsychotic drugs (in which we were not primarily
interested) from physical diseases in the proper
sense. For example, we did not analyze the adverse

event data in antipsychotic drug trials. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, a similarly
comprehensive review has to date not been undertaken. We hope that it will serve as a basis for
initiatives that will forthcome to ﬁght the high rates
of comorbidity in schizophrenia.
A number of factors probably account for the
high rates of co-morbid physical illnesses. One class
of these is related to the changes in the behaviour of
people with schizophrenia. Many of them, preoccupied by their psychotic symptoms, may fail to
seek treatment as a consequence. The presence of
negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as lack of
drive and decreased energy levels may also reduce
help-seeking and physical health check-ups. Cognitive disturbances may be another factor that could
reduce the patientsÕ communication skills in reporting their problems and managing their medication
(282, 283). People with schizophrenia are often
isolated and frequently fail to adhere to the recommendations of their doctors concerning treatment
and it can be assumed that they also have problems
in maintaining their treatment regimes for physical
illnesses (284). Patients with schizophrenia have a
lifestyle which in itself is an important risk factor for
a variety of physical illnesses. According to a recent
meta-analysis, 62% of people with schizophrenia
smoke, and many of them are using drugs and
alcohol (192). Although it has been claimed for a
very long time that patients with schizophrenia do
not exercise much and have poor diets, only recent
evidence has substantiated this claim (196, 235).
Second, there are a number of iatrogenic reasons
for the excess co-morbidity. Antipsychotic drugs
and other medications that patients with schizophrenia have necessarily to take, usually for many
years if not lifelong, are associated with a number
of side eﬀects such as weight gain, prolactin
increase, cardiac eﬀects, motor side-eﬀects, blood
dyscrasias and, not to be forgotten, can have many
untoward drug–drug interactions with other psychotropic and non-psychotropic drugs.
There are also a number of system-related
factors. Many people with schizophrenia are
unemployed and are not covered by health insurance (285). There is also evidence that patients with
schizophrenia have less access to health care, as we
have already mentioned in the introduction (9–15).
Once hospitalized, adverse events during and after
medical interventions occur more frequently than
in persons without schizophrenia (286). A problem
of many health systems is also that psychiatry is
not integrated into a general medical setting. Thus
patients with psychiatric problems do not have
adequate access to medical treatment. And in
many psychiatric centers, there may be a lack of

resources for performing the appropriate laboratory examinations and treatment interventions.
Last but not least, part of the problem, probably, is due to the behaviour of the psychiatrists who
often neglect their skills of recognizing and treating
physical illness. Sometimes they may consider
complaints as expressions of the patientsÕ mental
illness and thus miss a medical diagnosis. In the
current era of seeking ways to involve general
practitioners in the treatment of people with
schizophrenia, it will be important that they
become aware of the increased risks of physical
illness described above.
What needs to be done to change this unsatisfactory situation? We detected a number of areas
that have not been suﬃciently researched from an
epidemiological point of view. For example,
reviews on excess mortality found that people
with schizophrenia more frequently die from bacterial infections, but of which type of bacterial
infections these are related is unclear (4–6). More
studies are needed to understand the epidemiological aspects of the relationship between obesity and
diabetes in schizophrenia. Although substantial
work has been done to understand the role played
by antipsychotic drugs in the development of
physical diseases, with the exception of substance
abuse little is known about patient-related factors
(196, 235). There is also little evidence as to which
of the factors discussed above play the most
important role in the causation of the morbidity,
and whether treatment of these chronic conditions
can be eﬀective. Studies on relatives of people with
schizophrenia are promising tools to tease apart
genetic and lifestyle factors that may inﬂuence the
associations (58, 92).
Perhaps the most important area of intervention
is that of raising awareness of physicians in medical
specialties other than psychiatry about the frequent
co-morbidity between schizophrenia and physical
illness. Updating psychiatristsÕ skills of diagnosis
and treatment of physical illness is also urgent.
Finally, we must combat system-related factors.
Stigmatization of mental illness is still widely
prevalent. In many countries, most people with
schizophrenia do not have health insurance nor the
means to obtain treatment. The basic human rights
and legal protection of people with mental illness is
often neglected and conditions in which they live
are often terrible. In many countries, a signiﬁcant
number of people with mental illness end up in
prisons where their somatic complaints are not
taken seriously and where they receive no care for
it. Psychiatric hospitals and other institutions
dealing with mental health problems are often
under-equipped and do not have the possibility to

Improvements depend to a signiﬁcant degree on
us in the medical professions – who have to change
their attitudes and style of work if we are to deal
with the problems of physical illness occurring in
people with schizophrenia eﬀectively in the near
future.
