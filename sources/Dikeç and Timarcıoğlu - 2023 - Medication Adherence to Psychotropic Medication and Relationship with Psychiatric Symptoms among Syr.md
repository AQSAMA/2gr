Abstract: Background: Due to experiencing traumatic and stressful events, refugees are at risk
of having mental disorders. The refugees might need to use psychotropic agents to treat mental
disorders. It is essential to understand this population’s adherence rate to psychotropic medication.
Aim: This study aimed to evaluate adherence to psychotropic medication and the relationship with
psychiatric symptoms among Syrian refugees in Turkey. Method: The study design was descriptive
and correlational. The study was conducted with 55 Syrian refugees attending a community health
center in southern Turkey. The data was collected with General Medication Adherence Scale–Arabic
Version (GMAS–AR) and Brief Psychiatric Inventory (BPI). Results: 78.2% (n: 43) of the participants’
medication adherence was poor, and a significant negative and weak correlation was found at 0.01
level between GMAS–AR and BPI (r: −0.37). According to multiple linear regression analysis, the
model with gender and BPI was significant, and this model explained 19% of GMAS–AR total points
(p < 0.001). Conclusion: Mental health professionals should test the effectiveness of psychosocial
interventions that increase adherence to treatment for the cultural characteristics of societies.

1. Introduction
In recent years, people have been leaving their countries due to the world’s increasing
violence, war, disaster, and human rights violations. The countries they move to try to
establish a new order, provide social support and help refugees cope with their traumatic
experiences [1,2]. According to the International Organization of Migration (IOM) and the
United Nations report, Turkey is one of the countries that receive the most refugees [1,3–5].
Turkey, which has opened its borders to individuals from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran,
probably has one of the highest rates of transitory migrants and has the highest Syrian
refugee population [6].
Undoubtedly, refugees are the most in need of assistance among the entire migrant
population. During the war, refugees often experience the loss of family members, sexual
and physical abuse, and lack of shelter and nutrition. They also experience many social difficulties, such as language barriers, stigmatization, social isolation, economic problems, and
adjustment difficulties after displacement. Therefore, these individuals are at higher risk
for developing mental disorders [1,2,4,5,7–9]. It has been determined that they are at risk
regarding anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and psychotic disorders [1,2,10,11]. Due
to these emerging mental disorders, they need mental health services more frequently [12],
while they receive less psychotherapy [7]. Health services, especially mental health services, are provided through government services in Turkey and surrounding countries,
alongside humanitarian programs and the projects of non-government organizations for
refugees [4,13]. Although there is no study with a large sample on the use of mental health
services by Syrians in Turkey, it is noteworthy that this rate was low in the studies. In

Fuhr et al. [4], a study conducted in Istanbul showed that while 249 participants (15% of the
total) screened positive for either symptom of post-traumatic stress disorders, depression,
and anxiety, only 22 (9%) of them sought mental health care and 219 participants did not
(88%). The treatment gap was found for anxiety (90%) and depression (88%), too.
Treatment adherence could relate to patients’ compliance with health-related recommendations [14]. However, patients sometimes do not follow their diet or treatment
program as recommended. Non-adherence to treatment for mental disorders is a frequently encountered problem [15]. Many factors affect medication adherence. These are
patient-related (psychotic symptoms, previous non-adherence experience, inadequate social
support, age, education, etc.) [14,16], treatment-related (complexity of treatment regimen,
side effects, etc.) [14,17], health care professionals-related (lack of cooperation with the
treatment team, lack of therapeutic relationship, etc.), and system-related (short time allocated to patients, bureaucratic obstacles, etc.) [17]. Non-compliance with treatment causes
exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms and relapses [16], affecting hospital readmission.
Re-hospitalization increases patient care costs [14]. For this reason, it is vital to evaluate
treatment adherence and to improve it with appropriate psychosocial interventions [4].
The ethnicity of minority groups is one of the influencing factors that may negatively
impact medication adherence [8,14]. Although mental disorders are common in refugees, it
is reported that their adherence to psychotropic agents used for the treatment of mental
disorders is poor [7]. In a qualitative study conducted in Turkey, Doğan [12] found that
Syrian individuals had difficulties getting an appointment, expressing themselves, and
obtaining medications while receiving mental health services. It was determined that they
could not get the psychotropics from pharmacies, did not take them when they could
not find the medications, or tried to use them by reducing the dose. At this point, it
can be said that the adaptation of refugees toward mental health treatment is affected by
external factors.
On the other hand, culture is the most important factor shaping the perception of
illness and the perspective toward treatment. Culture may cause treatment adherence
problems by affecting the individual’s internal factors toward treatment [2]. Sacha [2]
found that the predictors of non-adherence to treatment were not examined in the studies
reviewed; however, the language issues of refugees indicated that barriers to receiving
health services might be related to this situation. For this reason, there is a need to examine
the factors that affect refugees’ treatment adherence and specific transcultural intervention
programs for this population [8].
Since Turkey is the leading refugee-hosting country, several studies have determined
mental health problems and comorbidities among Syrian refugees [9]. However, no research
on medication adherence to psychotropic medication and effecting factors of medication
adherence to psychotropic agents among refugees, especially Syrian refugees, has been
found in the literature. Determining adherence to psychotropic treatment and related
factors in Syrian refugees is crucial in developing interventions that can enhance treatment
adherence. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationship between medication
adherence to psychotropic agents and psychiatric symptoms among Syrian refugees who
attended a community health center in Turkey.
Research Questions
The research sought answers to the following two fundamental questions:
1.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design
This study was planned as a descriptive and correlational study design. It was a pilot
study prior to psychosocial interventions to increase the medication adherence of Syrian
refugees in Turkey.
2.2. Settings
This study was carried out in the community health center of a non-governmental
organization located in southern Turkey between 2 August 2022 and 26 September 2022.
2.3. Participants
Syrian refugees who attended the community health center were included in the
study. Inclusion criteria were being literate in Arabic, agreeing to participate in the study,
being between the ages of 18–65, being diagnosed with any mental disorder according
to DSM-V, and using any oral or parenteral psychotropic medications for the last three
months. Exclusion criteria were being of non-Syrian origin, illiteracy in Arabic and refusal
to participate in the study after being informed, not having any psychiatric disorder
diagnosis according to DSM-V, only seeking counseling or applying to the institution due
to physical problems, and using psychotropic medication less than the last three months.
In the study, the sample calculation of the known population was made. The population
of the study consisted of 74 individuals aged 18 and over, of Syrian nationality, and using
psychotropic drugs in the designated center. Sample 62 was determined with a 5% margin
of error and a 95% confidence interval in the sample calculation. Fifty-five people agreed to
participate in the study within the specified time. According to the sampling calculation,
88.70% of the sample was reached.
2.4. Measurements
The Personal Information Form, which includes sociodemographic and medicationrelated information, the General Medication Adherence Scale–Arabic Version, and the
Turkish Version of the Brief Symptom Inventory, were used to collect the data.
2.4.1. Personal Information Form
For the study, the form was prepared by the researchers by scanning the literature [2,17,18] and includes the sociodemographic, mental disorders, and treatment-related
characteristics of refugees. This form has a total of 11 questions.
2.4.2. General Medication Adherence Scale–Arabic Version (GMAS–AR)
Naqvi [18] developed this scale to measure medication adherence in chronic conditions,
and the scale was adapted to different languages in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia [19] apart
from English. It is a self-reporting scale with 11 items and a 4-point Likert scale. The total
score is obtained by summing all the items in the scale and varies between 0–33 points.
Those with a score of 27 and above have “good” treatment adherence; those who score
26 points or less are evaluated as “not good” for treatment adherence. There are no
subscales in the scale. The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the Arabic version of the scale was
0.86. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.73.
2.4.3. Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)
The Brief Symptom Inventory is a frequently used scale to evaluate mental health. The
scale developed by Derogatis [20] consists of 53 items and 9 subscales. The subscales of
BSI are somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, depression,
anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid thoughts, and psychoticism. The scale is a
5-point Likert scale and is a self-reporting scale. Items were graded as “0”, “not at all,” “4”,
or “too much.” It is a widely used and practical scale translated into 26 languages, applied
to the healthy population and individuals with mental disorders. The total score range of

Trauma Care 2023, 3

40

the scale varies between 0–212, and an assessment is made that the higher the score, the
higher the psychological symptoms. Subscale scores are obtained by dividing the sum of
the scores given to the items forming each subscale by the number of items. Subscale scores
can range from 0 to 4. The original scale reported that the subscale of Cronbach’s alpha
coefficients ranged between 0.71 and 0.85 [20]. Şahin [21] had done Turkish validity and
reliability of the scale, and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the total scale score was 0.96
and 0.55–0.86 for the subscales. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the scale was
0.95. The individuals filled out the Brief Symptom Inventory through an interpreter.
2.5. Ethical Considerations
Ethics committee approval was obtained dated 9 March 2022 and numbered 09.2022
fbu from Fenerbahçe University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee
before starting the study; written permission was obtained from the Turkish Red Crescent
Academy, where the study was conducted. In addition, verbal and written consent was
obtained from the individuals participating in the study and their legal representatives.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for
Windows 20.0 program. Descriptive numerical data of the study were analyzed using mean
and standard deviation, minimum and maximum, and categorical data as numbers and
percentages (%). Normality analysis was performed by examining Kurtosis and Skewness.
Kurtosis and Skewness values were evaluated between −1.96 and +1.96. Due to the normal
distribution of the data, the relationship between the scales was analyzed by Pearson
correlation analysis, and the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal Wallis was used to compare
scales and sociodemographic characteristics since the sample size in the eyes was <30.
The relationship between the non-normally distributed scale variables and the scales was
analyzed by Spearman Correlation analysis. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze
the predictors of treatment adherence as scales were disturbed normally. All values were
evaluated at p < 0.05 significance level.
3. Results
3.1. Main Characteristics of Total Sample
The sociodemographic characteristics of the individuals participating in the study are
shown in Table 1. The results determined that 52.7% were female, 65.5% perceived their
economic level as medium, 78.2% were married, and 81.8% were secondary or high school
graduates. It was determined that 58.2% of the refugees worked in a job with income, and
89.1% had a child. When the characteristics of mental disorders were examined, it was
determined that 45.5% were followed up with the diagnosis of anxiety disorder, 96.4% had
not received any inpatient treatment before, and 63.6% used antidepressants. When GMAS–
AR, and BSI total score averages were examined according to their sociodemographic
characteristics, a significant difference was found between the groups according to gender
and hospitalization (p < 0.05).
3.2. Correlation between GMAS–AR and BSI
GMAS–AR and BSI scale scores are given in Table 2. It was determined that 78.2%
(n: 43) of the refugees had poor adherence to treatment. According to the Spearman Correlation analysis performed between the scales, a negative and weak statistically significant
relationship was found.
3.3. Predictors of GMAS–AR
Multiple regression analysis was performed, and the Backward method was used
to determine the effect of gender, hospitalization, and BSI on GMAS–AR. Accordingly,
the established model was found to be statistically significant, and 22% of the GMAS–AR

Trauma Care 2023, 3

41

total scored average. It was determined that the model established with gender and BSI
explained 19%, and BSI explained 14% alone of the GMAS–AR total score average (Table 3).

4. Discussion
In this study, which was conducted to examine the relationship between treatment
adherence to psychotropics and psychiatric symptoms in a group of Syrian refugees in
Turkey, most refugees who participated in the study had low treatment adherence. When
the predictors of treatment adherence were examined, it was determined that psychiatric
symptoms explained 14% of the total GMAS–AR score. It is stated in the literature that nonadherence to psychotropic medication increases the symptoms of mental disorders, causes
relapses and recurrent hospitalizations, homelessness, lower quality of life, and increases
morbidity and mortality [15]. Since using psychotropic medication helps individuals to
manage and control symptoms, maintenance treatment is essential to prevent psychiatric
symptoms and relapses [22]. Non-adherence is a challenge of mental disorders and is
associated with adverse patient outcomes, including exacerbating psychiatric symptoms
and impaired functionality [23]. Since non-adherence increases psychiatric symptoms,
patients who have non-adherence could experience hospitalizations and emergency use [24].
Therefore, medication adherence to psychotropic medication has implications for prognosis
positively and protects long-term functionality. At this point, it can be said that the study
results were similar to the literature.
In this study, it was found that the adherence scores of men were higher than women’s.
According to Tan [14], non-adherence to psychotropic treatment is commonly observed in
young people and men. Individual sociodemographic variable, such as gender, is still not
fully understood regarding refugees’ adherence [2], and different results were found in
studies on gender and treatment adherence. In a meta-analysis, Semahegn [17] emphasizes
an inconsistency between studies’ results related to gender and treatment adherence [17].
It may be a cultural difference among Syrians. In addition, there were no differences
according to the sociodemographic characteristics of participants. It might be related to the
small sample size. Therefore, in future studies, it may be recommended to determine the
predictors of adherence to treatment with a large sample, especially in Syrian refugees.
Refugees, who are more at risk in terms of mental disorders due to the traumatic
events they have experienced, may need mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)
more frequently. However, they may experience difficulties accessing MHPSS due to
language barriers, such as a lack of translators, not knowing the language spoken in the
country, and economic or structural problems [10]. Again, the language barrier, insufficient
cooperation with the treatment team, and inability to inform about the treatment may also
affect adherence to the treatment. In Turkey, Doğan [12] reports that Syrian refugees have
difficulties obtaining medicine and are unable to receive services due to economic problems
or inability to meet transportation expenses, which affects their adherence to treatment.
Even though mental health services and medication treatments are entirely free in the
center where the study was conducted, it is noteworthy that treatment adherence is low.
In this study, many factors may have influenced the low adherence rate of refugees to
psychotropics. First, non-adherence to treatment may be associated with culturally negative
attitudes toward medication and mental disorders in Syrian refugees [10,25]. Bradl [7] has

Trauma Care 2023, 3

43

emphasized that the attitude toward medications is more negative among refugees from
the Middle East than among refugees from Turkey and Central Europe in their study with
refugees in Berlin. In the study of Fuhr [4], conducted with Syrian refugees in Istanbul,
Turkey, they investigated the reasons for those with psychiatric symptoms not initiating
the treatment they need. The participants did not believe that the treatment would reduce
the symptoms, would be a waste of time and cost, or it would cause more expenditure.
They did not know where and how to get help, and they thought that if they received
treatment, society would label them and exclude them. The fact that mental disorders are
still taboo and stigmatized in many countries and cultures negatively affects adherence
to treatment [1,2]; their study of Syrian refugees living in Germany determined that selfstigmatization negatively affects the mental health outcomes of refugees. In this study,
individuals may have accessed mental health services due to the trauma and stressors
they experienced. Although they have started treatment, they might not have been able to
continue due to stigmatization. It could be recommended that the investigation between
medication adherence, attitude, and stigmatization in this population in future studies.
Secondly, refugees sometimes express their health problems first to their family members or relatives, and they may resort to religious treatment methods [25]. They may expect
the clergy, who are described as healers and who have superpowers, to heal themselves.
Fuhr [4] found that Syrian refugees determined that they shared their mental problems with
their friends and families first and then told them to religious leaders in their study. Seeking
a remedy other than medicine, a cultural feature, may also affect treatment adherence.
Finally, most refugees in this study use antidepressants for anxiety or mood disorders. It
has been thought that the effects of antidepressants do not start immediately [26], side
effects occur first, and individuals think that the medications do not improve them.
5. Limitations
The results of this study were limited to the data collected on a group of Syrian
refugees and cannot be generalized. Another limitation of the study, since it was conducted
in a single center and was a pilot study, is its small sample size. In the study, since the
GMAS–AR was in Arabic, it was ensured that the individuals filled out forms based on
their declarations, but the BSI was filled out through an interpreter. In turn, this can affect
the results of individuals. In future studies, it may be recommended to use standardized
measurement tools that have been validated and reliable in the refugees’ mother tongue.
6. Conclusions
This study was a pilot study to assess the treatment adherence of a group of Syrian
refugees in Turkey and the relationship between adherence and psychiatric symptoms.
The treatment adherence to the psychotropic medication of the Syrian refugees who participated in this study was low. There was a statistically significant negative correlation
between the refugees’ adherence to psychotropic treatment and their psychiatric symptoms.
Ensuring that refugees in Turkey, whose number is increasing daily, benefit from mental
health services and reduce their psychiatric symptoms is crucial in protecting individuals’
functionality and reducing disability. At this point, increasing the treatment adherence of
refugees using psychotropic medications is essential. Mental health professionals should
develop or modify psychosocial interventions such as psychoeducational programs, telenursing interventions, adherence therapy (AT), cognitive behavioral techniques, and
motivational interviewing [27] to increase adherence to treatment for the cultural characteristics of societies. The effectiveness of the interventions should be tested. The authors
have planned to test the effectiveness of AT, which was a combined intervention on cognitive behavioral techniques, motivational interviewing, and psychoeducation. AT was a
collaborative and patient-centered program developed by Gray [22]. Six elements form
the therapy: assessment; medication problem-solving; a medication timeline; exploring
ambivalence; discussing beliefs and concerns about medication; and using medication in
the future. In a systematic review and meta-analysis in which six studies were evaluated, it

Trauma Care 2023, 3

44

was determined that AT reduces psychiatric symptoms [27], stating that AT could be used
to increase adherence to treatment in their guideline. As AT is patient-center and has a
flexible structure, in the next step, the authors should adapt AT to the Syrian culture. When
the culturally sensitive skills of mental health professionals are developed, a therapeutic
alliance can be achieved, and the causes of non-adherence to treatment can be explored
in depth.
