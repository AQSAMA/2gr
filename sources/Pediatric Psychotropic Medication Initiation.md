TOPIC: Psychotropic medication initiation and adherence is an
identiﬁed problem. This literature review explores factors that
determine families’ decisions to initiate, sustain, or discontinue
use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents.
Social exchange theory is used as a framework to explore
decisions to initiate and adhere to psychotropic medications.
PURPOSE: Contributing factors related to psychotropic
medication initiation, adherence, and discontinuation are
explored. Themes in the literature encompassing costs and
beneﬁts of psychotropic medication adherence include family
experiences with adverse effects, previous psychotropic
medication experience, medication psychoeducation, stigma,
societal views about psychotropic medication, particular
diagnosis, the effect of comorbid diagnosis on adherence,
attitudes and beliefs about medication by both children and
parents, and relationships with the provider. The impact of
family demographics including parent gender, age of the child,
ethnicity, and parent educational level on psychotropic
medication adherence is evaluated.
SOURCES: International and U.S. studies from Medline,
Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature and
PsychInfo evaluating medication initiation and adherence in the
pediatric psychiatric population and social exchange theory was
incorporated from relevant textbook resources.
CONCLUSIONS: Rewards experienced from medication
treatment include improvement in symptoms, school performance
and family relationships, and reduced level of parenting stress.
Identiﬁed costs include impact of adverse side effects, social
stigma, lack of response, fears of addiction, and changing the
child’s personality. Acceptance of the diagnosis inﬂuences
adherence while medication education has varying effects.
Families’ attitudes, beliefs and perceptions about psychiatric
illness and treatment play a large role in medication treatment
decisions. A trusting provider relationship has a positive effect
on adherence. Psychosocial treatment alternatives are preferred.
With maturation, adolescents have more inﬂuence on decisions
related to adherence.

Introduction
Psychotropic medication initiation and adherence in children and adolescents is an identiﬁed problem in the United
States and internationally. The research was obtained from
Medline, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health
Literature, and PsychInfo from 1973 through 2009. Key
search terms were psychotropic medications; medication
adherence in children and adolescents; and child and parent
perceptions of psychotropic medications. This article uses the
social exchange model as a framework to explore parents
and their children’s decisions to initiate and sustain medication treatment for youth with psychiatric disorders. This
framework will categorize the literature into broad sections
on how families interact with one another, society, and the
prescriber to make decisions about initiation and sustainability of psychotropic medication treatment for child and adolescent psychiatric illness. Societal inﬂuences, parental
psychotropic medication usage, parent and child knowledge
of psychiatric illness and medication, attitudes and beliefs
about psychiatric illness and treatment, the families’ relationship with providers, as well as demographic characteristics
will be explored. This article is highly relevant due to the
clear problems with psychotropic medication compliance in
children and adolescence. Social exchange theory is a particularly well suited framework from which to understand
the issues family members face in choosing to place children
and adolescents on medication, sustain medication treatment, and seek alternatives for psychiatric treatment.

Within social exchange theory, society is viewed as a
system in which social interactions consist of a trade in
valued resources including activities, tangibles, and intangibles (Homans, 1961). Examples of resources exchanged
include any combination of consumable goods, such as
151

Pediatric Psychotropic Medication Initiation and Adherence: A Literature Review Based
on Social Exchange Theory

medication or money, intangible goods like affection, attention, and information, and activities that involve energy
expenditure and time spent in activities (Lovaglia, 2005).
Social exchange theory includes the premise that individuals will make decisions based on maximizing rewards
and minimizing costs (Nye, 1979). “Rewards” are deﬁned as
“pleasures, satisfactions, and gratiﬁcations a person enjoys”
(Thibaut & Kelley, 1959, p. 12). The “costs” involve punishments experienced, the energy invested, or rewards foregone as a result of engaging in one behavior or course of
action rather than another (Blau, 1964). Blau (1964) also
describes social exchange costs as investment costs, direct
costs, and opportunity costs. Actors in a social exchange
model can be individuals or groups acting as a single unit
such as a family system. Actors are assumed to be rational,
able to calculate the ratio of costs to rewards and to choose
the plan that has the greatest probability of getting a desired
result (Homans, 1974). The theory assumes that the person
weighs the costs and rewards of alternative choices of
exchange based on the amounts of information they have
(Emerson, 1987). Two types of comparisons help rational
people make decisions, comparisons level (CL) and comparison level for alternatives (CLalt). Comparison level is the
standard a person expects in rewards and costs. CL is an
evolving, individual, subjective standard that determines
whether the exchange meets the individual’s expectations
(Nye, 1979; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959). CL is made up of societal norms for similar exchanges, past experiences, and
observations for similar exchanges. When relationship/
exchange outcomes exceed the CL, then satisfaction is generally high. CLAlt is an evolving individual subjective
standard that determines whether the current outcome
exceeds the individual’s other alternatives (Thibaut & Kelley,
1959).
Social exchange theory can be applied to each family’s
process of weighing the costs, rewards, and alternatives of
treatment for child and adolescent mental health problems,
particularly psychopharmacological treatment. This paper
explores the relationship among the family, medication,
society, the alternatives for treatment, and the prescriber.
Both CL and CLAlt affect the families’ decisions to commit
to medication treatment, weighing the recommended treatment option with the alternatives. When exploring the
concept of costs and rewards of psychotropic medication,
families consider the relative impact of a given choice.
Coleman (1990) states, “If the gain and loss is small, then it
is less important that the decision be a correct one, however
if gain is great and loss is great then one might seek more
information and will be more careful about making the
decision” (p. 103). When families weigh decisions to place
their child on medication for a psychiatric illness or change
treatment, it is typically perceived as a signiﬁcant gain or
loss. Therefore, careful information gathering and decision
152

making are usually an important part of the treatment
process.

Prescription Rates
Advances in psychotropic medications include greater
efﬁcacy, decreased side effect proﬁles, expanding medication
options, and increased willingness of prescribers to use psychotropic medications. These factors have led to increased
rates of prescriptions for psychotropic medications for school
age children and adolescents over the past decade, including
antipsychotics, stimulants, antidepressants, alpha agonists,
and mood stabilizers (Olfson, Marcus, Weissman, & Jensen,
2002; Staller, Wade, & Baker, 2005; Thomas, Conrad, Casler,
& Goodman, 2006; Zuvekas, Vitiello, & Norquist, 2006).
While rates of most psychotropic prescriptions in children
and adolescents are increasing, adherence to psychotropic
medication is problematic. Therefore, prescription rates may
not match actual usage of psychotropic medications. While
the majority of studies on psychotropic adherence have been
conducted in children and adolescents with ADHD on
stimulant medications, other research is emerging that evaluates other child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and
medication adherence.

Rates of Psychotropic Medication Adherence
Table 1 summarizes the known research on adherence
rates for psychotropic medications in youth. Four of the
studies evaluate children and adolescents with ADHD for
stimulant adherence, while three of the studies evaluate
psychotropic medication adherence in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. Differences in measuring
adherence between studies should be noted in Table 1,
including length of adherence, and inclusion or exclusion of
drug holidays as it impacts rates of adherence. Research
indicates adherence rates for psychotropic medication
ranges from 34% to 89%, with the majority of studies demonstrating adherence was problematic. Also the high compliance rate of 89% reported by parents of children with
ADHD was not consistent with actual saliva report measures (53.5%) (Pappadopulos et al., 2009). Parent and child
self-report measures of medication adherence in children
with bipolar disorder were higher compared with biological measures of adherence using serum concentration levels
(Drotar et al., 2007). These two studies used objective measures to highlight that clinicians may receive biased data
from parent and child reports of medication adherence.
Incorrect self-report measures could result in inappropriate
dosage adjustments, medication changes, or discontinuation
of medication. Prescribers should use objective measures
whenever possible to get accurate data on medication
adherence.

Measures used to assess adherence

Results

• Researchers examined prescription claims and
deﬁned adherence through (a) persistence, or
the sum of the number of treatment days for
each stimulant divided by the treatment
window (180 days) and (b) the ratio of the
actual number of days of therapy to the
optimum number of days of therapy.
• Medication non-compliance was documented
through thorough, routine contact with families
whose children were placed on stimulant
medication during a 10-month study.

• Persistence with stimulant
medication in children and
adolescents was 43% (SD 0.30)

• Parents completed a daily dosing record, which
reﬂected the dose taken by the child each day.
Adherence was deﬁned as the total number of
days the prescribed medication was taken
divided by the number of days in the study.

• Participants’ medication regimens were
documented by their parents according to an
estimation of the number of medication doses
and missed therapy appointments over a one
month period.

Carter, 2008; Epstein, Saltman-Benaiah, Ohare, Goll, & Tuck,

lower than rates of psychiatric diagnoses in
children and adolescents where medication is
viewed as the ﬁrst line treatment.

While evidence supports that the stimulants are the best
treatment option for ADHD, researchers found medication
was utilized in approximately half of the youth diagnosed
with ADHD (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999). The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (2005) conducted the
National Survey of Children’s Health interviewing parents of
more than 100,000 children ages 4–17 years diagnosed with
ADHD. The study found that the rate of lifetime childhood
diagnosis of ADHD was 7.8%, whereas only 4.3% received
medication treatment.

Costs of Psychiatric Illness
Research indicates that there are signiﬁcant costs to delaying or not treating psychiatric illness. Costs of untreated psychiatric problems include longer duration of illness, more
psychiatric episodes (Altamura, Dell’Osso, Vismara, &
Mundo, 2008); reduced likelihood of remission, poorer functional outcome, increasing psychopathology (Clarke et al.,
2006) and greater relapse rates (Keller, 2004). Therefore,
delays in medication treatment from ﬁrst symptom expression may cause youth to be more symptomatic.
Youth with untreated mental health problems suffer from
a number of adverse outcomes. In addition to increased psychiatric symptoms, researchers found untreated youth had
poorer academic performance (Barkley, Fischer, Edelbrock, &
Smallish 1990; Brook, Stimmel, Zhang, & Brook, 2008;
DuPaul et al., 2004; Frazier, Youngstrom, Glutting, &
Watkins, 2007; Fröjd et al., 2008; Garnefski, 2000; Loe &
Feldman, 2007) and increased interpersonal peer problems
(Garnefski, 2000; Hoza et al., 2005; Zimmer-Gembeck,
Hunter, Waters, & Pronk, 2009). Safety issues such as
increased risk for suicide (Hatcher-Kay & King, 2003) and
poorer driving (Barkley, Guevremont, Anastopoulos,
DuPaul, & Shelton 1993; Barkley, Murphy, & Kwasnik, 1996)
have also been associated with untreated child and adoles154

Social exchange theory postulates that changing people to
give them skills and abilities to enable them to act in new ways
creates human capital (Blau, 1964). Medication treatment has
helped improve psychiatric symptoms in a wide range of
child and adolescent psychiatric disorders, which has led
many youth to have higher quality of life (Birmaher et al.,
2003; Conners, 2002; Cox, Humphrey, Merkel, Penberthy, &
Kovatchev, 2004; Hamrin & Pachler 2005, 2007; Hinshaw,
Hendker, Whalen, Erhardt, & Dunnington 1989; MTA Cooperative Group, 1999; Rapoport & Denney, 2000; RUPP Anxiety
Group, 2001; Rynn, Siqueland, & Rickels, 2001; Sikich, Hamer,
Bashford, Sheitman, & Lieberman, 2004; Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) Team, 2004). While
parents demonstrate concern about addiction to psychotropic
medication (Lazaratou, Anagnostopoulous, Alevizos,
Haviara, & Ploumpidis, 2007), researchers have found that
stimulant medications actually prevented drug use, abuse,
and dependence (Barkely, Fischer, Smallish, & Fletcher, 2003;
Biederman, 2003). Psychotropic medication treatment has
demonstrated improvement in children’s and adolescent’s
academic performance (Gittleman-Klein & Klein, 1973; Yang,
Chung, Chen, & Chen, 2004), and peer relationships
(Hinshaw et al., 1989). Methylphenidate was also found to
decrease inattentive driving errors and improve driving performance (Cox et al., 2004). Hansen and Hansen (2006)
reported parental accounts of the beneﬁts of stimulant medication for children with ADHD included improved family
relationships, reduced level of parenting stress, improved
interactions with their child, improved sibling relationships,
improved school performance, and improved household routines. Child reports from Efron, Jarman, and Barker’s (1998)
stimulant study regarding beneﬁts were improved ability to
do school work, improved peer relationships, and improved
concentration and focus. Thus, initiation and adherence to
psychotropic treatment plans can reduce or eliminate many of
the costs associated with the alternative of leaving the problem
untreated.

effects deter youth and their families from pursing medication initiation and continuation as identiﬁed by several
studies (Charach, Skyba, Cook & Antle, 2006; Chavira, Stein,

fore, children and families may discontinue medication if
they see no perceived beneﬁts or the cost outweighs the
beneﬁts of medication.
Providers need to attend to parents, and youth’s perceptions of the physical, social, and psychological costs of
treatment. Parents interviewed in these studies were concerned about the long-term effect of medication on their
child’s health, adverse side effects as well as lack of
symptom reduction. Social and psychological concerns of
parents included feelings of guilt, lack of social support,
social acceptability of medication, and fears of decreased
self esteem, embarrassment, and addiction. Providers
should evaluate children’s potential feeling of embarrassment and fears that medication will change their personality. Providers may increase adherence by spending time
with the family on adjustment to their diagnosis and
provide emotional support in order for treatment interventions to be accepted. These studies help us gain a better
understanding of the lack of perceived reward youth and

Societal Views of Psychotropic Medication
Coleman’s (1990) social theory indicates that individual
choices are affected by the system level norms, so that the

individual’s action is a reﬂection of conformity to the larger
society’s norms. Levi-Strauss (1969) described that external
social forces in the forms of norms and values regulated
exchange behavior. In our society, cultural messages exist
that transmit fears regarding the use of psychiatric medications for children, creating ambilivance for parents and children who are making these decisions.

(2004), and Croghan et al. (2003) evaluated the lay public’s
157

on Social Exchange Theory

attitudes on psychotropic medication use in children from
the 1998 General Social Survey’s Pressing Issues in Health
and Medical Care Model. Results indicated that 57% of the
public would be willing to give general medication to children if the child expressed suicidal ideation, 34.2% would
be willing to give medications if the child exhibited
oppositional-deﬁant symptoms, but only 29.5% would be
willing to give medication to children with ADHD symptoms. The participants were less willing to give ﬂuoxetine to
children, even in situations where children expressed suicidal thoughts, despite being aware that ﬂuoxetine is an antidepressant. The study was unable to account for respondent’s
views negative views of ﬂuoxetine. The strongest noted predictors of adherence were trust in the physician, general
attitudes toward psychotropic medications, and whether the
participant would take medication for psychiatric disorders
themselves. Americans in this dataset were resistant to using
psychotropic medications despite their knowledge and
understanding of psychiatric conditions and the effectiveness medication has on treating them.

Stigma as a Cost of Mental Illness and Psychiatric
Medication
Stigma associated with mental illness and psychotropic
use has been a demonstrated deterrent to medication adherence. Researchers who speciﬁcally evaluated the implications of stigma on medication adherence found that
respondents believed stigma was a result of mental health
treatment during childhood, which produced rejection at
school (45%), experience of parental failure (36%), and
negative ramiﬁcations in adulthood (43%). Regarding medication treatment for children with mental health problems,
95% of respondents felt physicians overmedicated children,
68% felt medication caused long-term negative developmental effects, 66% reported giving children medication
only delayed dealing with children’s real problems, and
50% felt psychotropic medications would blunt the child’s
personality and would prevent families from working out
problems (Pescosolido, Perry Martin, McLeod, & Jensen,
2007).
Harpur, Thompson, Daley, Abikoff, and Sonuga-Barke
(2008) evaluated 35 parents and children taking stimulant
medication. Perceived costs of stigma by children and
parents correlated with resistance, decreased consistency,
and poor child adherence to medication. Meaux, Hester,
Smith, and Shoptaw (2006) found social stigma and feeling
different from peers were reasons why children stopped
taking medications for ADHD. In addition, McElearney,
Fitzpatrick, Farrell, King, & Lynch (2005) found only 32%
of children who were taking stimulant medication for
ADHD were willing to tell their peers that they were on
medication.
158

Stigma is a cost to youth as it can result in social rejection.
Social exchange posits that individuals will calculate the ratio
of costs to rewards and seek to maximize rewards and avoid
costs (Nye, 1979). Therefore, if stigma outweighs the rewards
of the medication, families may seek other alternatives or
discontinue the medication treatment.

Therefore, if stigma outweighs the rewards of
the medication, families may seek other
alternatives or discontinue the medication
treatment.

Factors That Inﬂuence a Family’s Decision to
Initiate Psychiatric Treatment
While there are limited data that provides us with the
reasons families initiate psychiatric treatment for their child,
Williamson, Koro-Ljungberg, and Bussing (2009) conducted
a qualitative analysis of a small sample of eight youth with
ADHD. They found that a critical incident such as an aggressive episode, learning problems, school failure, sexual abuse,
substance use, and other self-destructive behaviors had the
effect of moving parents to seek treatment for their teenager.
The family’s previous self-care strategies no longer functioned protectively, and the crisis moved the family in the
direction of professional care. The teens that did not receive
treatment for their ADHD were high achieving individuals in
school who used the families’ (parents and siblings) assistance to manage educational demands. However, family
assistance did not help with symptoms of sleep problems,
impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention. Until the crisis
occurred, symptoms were tolerated as typical of the teen’s
functioning. After the crisis, ADHD symptoms were investigated as a possible cause of the crisis. ADHD care in elementary school did not necessarily improve teens’ and parents’
understanding of the developmental course of ADHD. This
study illustrates the concept in social exchange that families
may be satisﬁed with using their own alternative strategies
for managing mental illness until the situation exceeds the
resources they have for managing the symptoms. The family
may see the psychiatric problems as exceeding the social
norms of the child’s peers and then seek professional assistance to identify new alternative solutions to the problem.
McNeal et al. (2000) and Farone, Biederman, and Zimmerman (2007) found greater illness concern and severity of
symptoms in youth with ADHD positively correlated to
increase in perception of medication reward and adherence.

Measures used to
assess adherence

Results

• Researchers examined prescription claims
and deﬁned adherence through (a)
persistence, or the sum of the number of
treatment days for each stimulant divided
by the speciﬁed treatment window of 180
days, and (b) the ratio of the actual
number of days of therapy to the
optimum number of days of therapy
• Children were interviewed by a
researcher and/or their physician, and
the sessions were rated through four
criteria (a) conﬁdence in the credibility of
the child’s response, (b) child’s perception
of the helpfulness of the medication, (c)
acceptance of the medication, and (d)
inconsistencies, both internal and external
• Participants’ parents documented their
child’s medication regimen and other
recommended supplementary treatments.
Parent questionnaires (measured on an
11-point Likert scale) examined their
perceptions of the effectiveness of these
different treatments.
• Subjective judgment and daily diaries of
medication adherence were employed,
but poor adherence was reﬂected in
mothers’ reports of their child missing
more than 14 days of his or her
methylphenidate treatment on a daily
basis for one month

• Children ages 5–9 (n = 4,500)
demonstrated better persistence
with stimulant medications than
10–14-year-olds (n = 4,347) and
15–18 year olds (n = 702)

• 33% of children ages 6–10
objected to taking medication for
the ﬁrst time compared with 75%
of children ages 12 and up

• Medication adherence in
adolescents was higher than
rates previously documented in
adults with bipolar disorder

• Older participants demonstrated
poorer medication adherence. (A
one year increment in age
increased the risk of
nonadherence by 1.24 times.)
• An increase in a participant’s
parents’ age predicted greater
risk for poor medication
management.

ADHD, attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder.

Thiruchelvan, Charach, and Schachar (2001) found higher
teacher rated ADHD correlated with greater adherence to
stimulant treatment. Hansen and Hansen (2006) found that
the main reasons parents sought treatment for their child’s
ADHD symptoms were to improve behavior at school and at
home. Receiving external feedback from the school or society
related to improving the child’s school behavior, inﬂuenced
parents’ decisions to pursue medication treatment. These
ﬁndings conﬁrm that pursuit of medication treatment as an
option by families’ increases as the severity and complexity
of psychiatric symptoms increases.

Age Effects on Adherence
Table 5 contains a summary of the research data on the
effects of age on psychotropic medication adherence. Many
JCAPN Volume 23, Number 3, August, 2010

researchers have found that younger children exhibit better
adherence to psychotropic medications than older children.
This ﬁnding may be attributed to the stronger inﬂuence and
power parental ﬁgures have in younger children’s lives. Blau
(1964) acknowledges that an individual can resist compliance
if he or she does not depend on others for rewards. This
theory assumes that the more dependant one individual is on
the other, the more compliant they will be (Thibaut & Kelley,
1959). In looking at age from a social exchange perspective, it
may lead one to conclude that parents have a more powerful
role in inﬂuencing medication adherence for a younger child
than an adolescent. Adolescents may be responsible for
deciding whether to take medication, whereas a younger
child may be dependent on the parents’ decision to take the
medication, such that it may be the parent who directly
administers the medication to a younger child, whereas
159

on Social Exchange Theory

adolescents may be responsible for their own medication
administration.

Do Parents and Children Perceive the Costs and
Beneﬁts of Medication Similarly?
Social exchange theory hypothesizes that when immediate proﬁts are equal, actors choose according to which alternative provides the most proﬁt in the long-term (White &
Klein, 2008). This could cause a conﬂict over medication treatment as parents, who are in the formal operations stage of
cognitive development, are able to contemplate long-term
goals for their child’s symptoms and functioning. Children,
who are in the concrete stage of cognitive development, are
focused on the present and want immediate rewards and
decreased costs. Some of the following research highlights
the different values placed on medication between child and
parent.
McNeal et al. (2000) conducted a risk/beneﬁt analysis of
children and parents’ perceptions about taking stimulant
medications. Mothers differed signiﬁcantly from their children with an increased level of knowledge about their child’s
medication compared to the child’s knowledge. Mothers also
viewed the medication as more beneﬁcial than children. Both
mothers and children, however, had the same perception
about the level of side effects, costs, and barriers. Fifty-one
percent of the children reported that they did not view their
disorder as an illness. The researchers found as children with
ADHD increased in their illness concern and severity, it was
positively related to increase in their perception of medication beneﬁt. When side effects increased, mothers perceived
additional costs of continuing to give the child the medication, leading to decreased adherence. Efron et al. (1998)
evaluated 102 children with ADHD and their parents to
assess their perceptions of treatment with stimulant medication. As seen in Table 4, disagreements between the child and
parents’ perceptions of the medication were about response,
with parents endorsing stronger views on positive response
than children. Adverse effects were the primary reason for
children having a negative view of the medication.

Does Parental Psychiatric Treatment Inﬂuence
Attitudes Toward Child Psychiatric Treatment?
Social exchange theory indicates that rational actors who
have experienced previous success with resources will place
more value on the same action (Homans, 1974). There is a
correlation between parents’ direct experiences with psychiatric illness and psychotropic medication and their willingness to try psychiatric medication for their child’s psychiatric
problem. One hundred and ﬁfty-six parents, who were on
psychiatric medication themselves for a mood disorder, were
recruited to determine parental attitudes toward medication
160

intervention for their children. The majority of parents
strongly endorsed that they would use acute medication
treatment in their child at high risk for affective disorders as
well as for long-term treatment before the onset of severe
symptoms (Post, Leverich, Fergus, Miller, & Luckenbaugh,
2002). Also, data from Chavira et al. (2003) suggests that
parents who have a psychiatric treatment history are more
accepting of mental health treatment for their children.
Therefore, parents who have had a mood disorder and have
had positive interactions with medication treatment may see
their own successful treatment as an indicative of giving
their child medication for the same disorder. Also, these
parents have a comparison level from which to set expectations about perceived beneﬁts, costs, and alternatives for
their child. It can be ascertained that parents in these studies
viewed the level of beneﬁt exceeding the level of cost that
their child would receive.

Does Family Distress Inﬂuence Psychotropic
Medication Adherence?
According to social exchange theory, commitment is inﬂuenced by trust, rewards, and reciprocity in relationships
(Sabatelli, 1999). Breakdowns in parent–child relationships
may cause the child to have trouble perceiving the parent as
a legitimate authority, causing the child to have decreased
compliance. Family distress may also interfere with the parent’s commitment to promotion of mental health strategies
and provision of rewards children received for psychiatric
care. As social exchange theory describes, the negotiation
between actors is critical, particularly when it concerns
importance of a mental health problem and treatment.
Gau et al. (2006) found that youth with poor adherence to
psychotropic medication correlated with maternal psychological distress, inappropriate parenting, less family support,
impaired parent–child interactions, and increased problems
at home. Drotar et al. (2007) evaluated the adherence to psychotropic medication in 107 youth with bipolar disorder and
found that maternal and paternal hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder, as well as less adaptive family functioning,
were related to medication nonadherence. Hack and Chow
(2001) reviewed compliance to pediatric psychotropic medications and found that family problems and parent–child
communication difﬁculties were both factors that decreased
pediatric compliance. These studies show that family distress
impaired parenting practices, difﬁcult parent–child interactions, family communication problems, and parental psychiatric hospitalization led to decreased medication compliance.
In summary, these research ﬁndings support that parent
and child interactions including family healthcare values,
personal parental experiences with mental health problems,
parent–child relationship issues, level of dependency of the
child on the parent, and developmental cognitive differences
JCAPN Volume 23, Number 3, August, 2010

between children and parents all inﬂuence medication
adherence outcomes.

Parental Level of Education and Gender Effects on
Perceptions of Medication
Lazaratou et al. (2007) found that parents with greater
levels of education demonstrated fewer fears about psychotropic medication causing addiction. Men gave more negative responses for psychotropic medications than women.
Lastly, parents were more fearful of psychotropic medication
than they were of other types of medication.
Formal education and increased cognitive ability may
give families more resources to gain further insight into their
child’s medication and psychiatric treatment options.
Mothers are typically more involved in obtaining information about their child’s treatment by attending the child’s
medical appointments, talking to others about the treatment,
and conducting their own research on the topic. Mothers are
the majority of informants on psychotropic medication treatment in this review of the literature.

Mothers are the majority of informants on
psychotropic medication treatment in this
review of the literature.

However, Singh (2003) is one of the few researchers who
did evaluate both mothers’ and fathers’ perspectives on
ADHD symptoms, diagnosis, and drug treatment. Singh
found fathers were resistant to a medical framework, with
only 18% agreeing that their sons’ ADHD behaviors warranted medical attention. Fathers reported that their sons’
behavior was a result of indulgent mothering, lack of motivation, and “boys will be boys” rationale. Many fathers identiﬁed with the sons’ symptomatic behaviors and
approximately 40% were resistant to drug treatment with
stimulants. A number of fathers saw the positive effects of
drug treatment; however, they continued to question
whether their sons’ behaviors required drug treatment. Singh
found these factors could explain fathers’ absences from
clinical evaluations.

Does Medication Education Inﬂuence Adherence?
One of the key premises in social exchange theory is that
rational actors can weigh the options because they are knowledgeable about the costs and rewards (Homans, 1974). Social
exchange theory also indicates that information will have the
JCAPN Volume 23, Number 3, August, 2010

effect of changing one’s estimate of the probability of gain.
Nye (1979) asserts that people act in accordance with the best
information they have available to them.
Several researchers explored the impact of education on
medication compliance. Berger, Dor, Nevo, and Goldzweig
(2008) evaluated parents of children with ADHD and found
that the majority initially had negative information, which
caused negative attitudes toward methylphenidate. Ninetytwo percent of parents and children said that the information
provided by the neurologist was the most effective factor in
their decision to accept methylphenidate as a method of
treatment.
Coletti, Leigh, Gallelli, and Kafantaris (2005) found education and booster session improved compliance in 38 adolescents with bipolar disorder. In addition, Charach, Volpe,
Boydell, and Gearing (2008) found value in medication psychoeducation, including understanding that patients and
parents must adjust to their diagnosis; exploration of ideas
and beliefs about treatment; and cognizance that treatment
perceptions and beliefs are not static in adolescents and
young adults who have experienced psychosis. Researchers
Johnston, Hommersen, and Seipp (2008) evaluated mothers
of 109 boys ages 5–12 with ADHD. They found education
about medication is helpful to parents initiating treatment;
however, it was not helpful in maintaining adherence over
time.
Monastra (2005) evaluated the effects of neuro-educational
intervention on initiation and treatment over a 2-year period
in children with ADHD. Researchers found that the impact of
the neuroeducational intervention was signiﬁcant for both in
the percentage of parents who began medication treatment
after the evaluation (70%) and signiﬁcant for patients who
were receiving treatment 2 years after the evaluation (95%).
The study demonstrated the importance of addressing
parents’ fears, how ADHD affects the child’s brain functioning, and how medications can impact the child’s functioning.
While the patients’ medication knowledge did not correlate
with post-hospital behavior, the patients’ attitudes about
pharmacotherapy did correlate with the adolescent’s post
discharge compliance. Other researchers have also found
higher medication adherence in parents who received neuropsychoeducational training than in parents who did not
receive the neuropsychoeducational training (Brown,
Deacon, Abramowitz, Dammann, & Whiteside, 2006;
Johnston & Hommersen, 2007).
While many researchers have found educational interventions inﬂuenced psychotropic adherence, Bastiaens (1995)
found educational intervention did not positively inﬂuence
acceptance of psychotropic medication. Bastiaen’s study
evaluated 30 in-patient adolescents and their mothers admitted for suicidal behavior and diagnosed with a mood disorder. They were treated with the antidepressants, mainly
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Patients and
161

Pediatric Psychotropic Medication Initiation and Adherence: A Literature Review Based
on Social Exchange Theory

parents received written education material about the psychiatric disorder, their medication treatment, drug names,
doses, and common adverse effects from the prescribing psychiatrist. Despite understanding the beneﬁts and effectiveness of psychotropic medications, parents in this study did
not ﬁnd medication treatment to be the most acceptable intervention.
While educating families about the beneﬁts, costs, and
types of treatment available is an imperative part of the prescriber’s role, the research ﬁndings demonstrate that factors
such as illness beliefs, adjustment to illness, as well as perceptions of treatment may have a more inﬂuential role in
inﬂuencing one’s sense of identity and adherence. In addition to providing education, the prescriber must recognize
that patients and parents need time to adjust to their diagnosis. Exploring families’ beliefs about mental health and treatment as well as weighing the treatment options should occur
with the provider. The family’s experiences with mental
health and treatment continue to be reﬁned through the treatment process based on symptom expression and response to
treatment and therefore open communication about the
treatment plan needs to be discussed and reﬁned during the
treatment process.

Ethnic Differences in Medication Adherence
Several researchers found that being of ethnic minority
negatively impacted compliance. Researchers looking at
parental ratings of acceptability of pharmacological treatments for children with ADHD found Caucasian families
were more likely to pursue a recommendation for psychopharmacological treatment than non-Caucasian families
(Buckstein, 2004; Chavira et al., 2003; Farone et al., 2007;
Krain, Kendall, & Power, 2005). Treatment ineffectiveness
was not the reason for nonadherence in African American
youth receiving ADHD treatment in Miller, Nigg, and Miller’s (2009) review of the literature. Instead they found the
parent’s understanding of ADHD played a role in low rates
of help seeking and stimulant medication use. Olaniyan et al.
(2007) found African American parents were skeptical of
diagnosis of ADHD for their child and had difﬁculty accepting it as a medical illness requiring medical treatment. In
obtaining African American parents views of barriers to psychiatric treatment for their children with ADHD, researchers
found barriers included not knowing where to go for help,
expecting the problem to improve without intervention,
a lack of trust in providers, and disparities in quality and
accessibility of care (Bussing, Gary, Mills, & Garvan, 2003).
Mychailyszyn, dosReis, and Myers (2008) suggest that for
African American parents who do not perceive ADHD as an
illness, they will beneﬁt from information about the symptoms that differentiate normal development from ADHD
symptoms.
162

Conversely, Patel, DelBello, Keck, and Strakowski (2005)
found African American youth had similar adherence with
psychotropic medication treatment compared with Caucasian youth. Patel et al.’s research on adolescents with bipolar
disorder and ADHD demonstrated similar adherence rates
between African American adolescents and Caucasian adolescents prescribed atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers after adjusting for psychosis. The African American
patients had a higher frequency of mental health contacts,
which may have resulted in the establishment of an effective
patient provider relationship with the ability to reinforce
medical education. Arnold et al. (2003) found in the 111
African Americans youths who participated in the MTA
study that they beneﬁtted more from the behavioral management treatment plus medication treatment compared with
the medication treatment alone. Arcia, Fernandez, and
Jaquez (2004) evaluated 62 Latina mothers and found that
89% of mothers did not see stimulant medication as a desirable treatment option for their children with ADHD. The
perceived costs of stimulant medication were addiction,
dulling of cognition, social stigma, and an inappropriate
treatment option for behavioral problems. Mothers in this
study avoided going to the doctor or clinic, gave less medicine than prescribed, or discontinued administration. The
researchers in the study found the majority of mothers who
participated to be quite rational.

Does Perceived Beneﬁt Increase Psychotropic
Medication Adherence?
Social exchange theory recognizes that individuals behave
in ways that increase outcomes they positively value and
decrease outcomes they negatively value (White & Klein,
2008). Therefore, it has been documented that positive beliefs
and expectations held about a medication’s value directly
inﬂuences adherence, as found in the literature. Patel et al.
(2005) evaluated 32 youth with bipolar disorder and found
that subjects who perceived greater beneﬁts from the drug
exhibited better treatment adherence. Pogge et al. (2005)
examined adolescents who were being treated with atypical
antipsychotics and found that there is a relationship between
positive beliefs about efﬁcacy of treatment and higher rates
of adherence. Townsend, Floersch, and Findling (2009) found
that positive attitudes, such as feeling like one is control of
his or her life while on medication, as well as an adolescent
feeling that his or her thoughts were clearer when taking
psychotropic medication, were indicative of medication
adherence. Sleator et al. (1982) discovered that children were
able to see the beneﬁts of treatment and comply with treatment, but did not like taking the medication. Berger et al.
(2008) found that one of the main contributing factors
leading families to keep their child on stimulant medication
for their child’s ADHD was experiencing positive effects
JCAPN Volume 23, Number 3, August, 2010

from the medication. Holzinger, Lofﬂner, Muller, Priebe, and
Angermeyer (2002) found that in patients with schizophrenia, the patient’s assessment of drug treatment effectiveness
had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on medication compliance. Bastiaens (1995) evaluated 30 in-patient adolescents and their
mothers who were admitted for suicidal behavior and diagnosed with a mood disorder. These youth were treated with
antidepressants, mainly SSRIs. Patients who expressed positive affect or ideas about their medication were found to have
a much better post-hospitalization compliance than patients
who, despite behavioral cooperation during hospitalization,
expressed negative emotions or thoughts.

Patients who expressed positive affect or ideas
about their medication were found to have a
much better post-hospitalization compliance
than patients who, despite behavioral
cooperation during hospitalization, expressed
negative emotions or thoughts.

Therefore, positive perceptions about medications and
their beneﬁts may be one of the strongest predictors of positive adherence to medication treatment.

Presence of Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders
Inﬂuence on Medication Adherence
Research shows that comorbid psychiatric disorders
directly inﬂuence medication adherence. Table 6 illustrates
that in general psychopharmacology use is greater in children with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The type of
comorbid psychiatric diagnosis can also inﬂuence adherence.
While the data are mixed on whether youth with comorbid
oppositional deﬁant disorder decreases adherence rates,
researchers have found having a comorbid substance abuse
disorder decreases adherence rates of psychotropic medications. Further research is needed to assess how symptom
severity and the number and type of psychiatric diagnoses
inﬂuences adherence.

Family Preferences for Types of
Psychiatric Treatment
Social exchange theory postulates that actors behave rationally by cognitively weighing the cost and beneﬁts of alternative choices of exchange partners and actions, based on
JCAPN Volume 23, Number 3, August, 2010

amounts of information available (Emerson, 1987). Data consistently show that parents found nonpharmacological interventions for children with psychiatric illnesses to be
preferable and more acceptable treatments compared with
pharmacological treatments. When comparing the CL alternatives of psychosocial treatments to psychopharmacological
treatments, psychosocial treatments are perceived to have
greater rewards by families, which could have the result of
greater adherence to treatment of psychiatric illness.
Croghan and colleague’s (2003) investigation of the
American publics’ views on psychopharmacology discovered that Americans have generally positive views of psychotropic medication and understand them to be effective, but
most Americans are more willing to seek therapy and behavioral interventions rather than take medication. Research on
parents of children with ADHDs views on stimulant medication indicate that parents prefer behavioral interventions
and counseling over stimulant medication use (Buckstein,
2004; Bussing et al., 2003; Charach et al., 2006; Corkum,
Rimer, & Schacher, 1999; DosReis et al., 2003; Johnston et al.,
2008; Krain et al., 2005; Swanson, 2003). Data establish that
parents’ support of counseling over psychopharmacology is
not speciﬁc to ADHD, but for other psychiatric disorders too,
including anxiety disorders, depression, and schizophrenia.
Two different studies exploring parents’ perceptions on
pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders found that
medication is less favored than counseling (Brown et al.,
2006; Chavira et al., 2003). Brown et al. (2006) identiﬁed that
awareness of the effectiveness of combinations of medication
and CBT was not persuasive enough for parents to accept
psychopharmacology, and parents still favored CBT as the
therapy of choice for their children. A study of mothers’
opinions on treatments for childhood depression also
showed that behavioral interventions were more acceptable
and preferred than psychopharmacology, even with more
severe depressive symptoms (Tarnowski, Simonian, Bekeny,
& Park, 1992). Lazaratou et al. (2007) discovered that when
asked about treatment for all psychiatric disorders, parents
thought behavioral treatment was the best option, even in
childhood onset of schizophrenia. Though some literature
suggests that minority parents are more likely to prefer counseling than medication (Bussing et al., 2003; DosReis et al.,
2003), the bulk of the literature suggests that despite ethnic
and sociodemographic differences in some attitudes and
beliefs about psychiatric illnesses and treatments, parents of
all ethnicities and backgrounds support behavioral and
counseling methods as a ﬁrst line treatment over psychopharmacology (Buckstein, 2004; Croghan et al., 2003;
McLeod et al., 2004).
In social exchange theory, the guiding principles of comparison levels for alternatives highlight that families and
individuals are evaluating treatment alternatives to get their
psychiatric needs met. Social exchange theory describes that

Measures used to assess the presence
of comorbid disorders
• Two measures were used to assess
and control for comorbid disorders
when studying adherence in youth
with ADHD: the PICS (Schachar
et al., 1999) and the TTI (Tannock
et al., 1999)
• 1,598 facilities were randomly
selected from the 1994 Inventory of
Mental Health Organizations and
General Hospital Mental Health
Services. Staff at each facility
completed data collection forms
based on case records for randomly
selected clients. Weights were then
calculated to generate national
estimates.

• Participants were discharged from
the hospital on olanzapine,
risperidone, and quetiapine and a
follow-up survey was sent to
parents to measure adherence to
prescribed medications.
• Adolescents were assessed for
baseline alcohol and cannabis use
disorders, affective state (manic
versus mixed), and psychosis, as
well as co-occurring ADHD,
conduct disorder, oppositional
deﬁant disorder, and anxiety
disorders during the evaluation
process
• Subjects were contacted 90 days to
18 months following discharge
from a hospital to assess whether
they were still taking their
medication. During the interview
process, patients were asked about
their substance use history.
• The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised
(SCL-90-R; Derogatis, 1975) was also
used to reveal dimensions of
somatization, obsessive-compulsive
features, interpersonal sensitivity,
depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic
anxiety, paranoid ideation, and
psychoticism.

Results
• The presence of oppositional deﬁant
disorder with a diagnosis of ADHD
made a youth eleven times more
likely to exhibit medication
nonadherence
• Youth with one psychiatric
diagnosis had a medication use rate
of 28.9%, compared with 40.4% of
those who had two diagnoses
• Youth with conduct disorder alone
had a medication use rate of 23.4%,
compared with 35.4% of those who
had conduct disorder and another
adjustment disorder
• Medication use was 25.5% for youth
with co-occurring adjustment
disorders compared with 12.2% of
those with a single diagnosis
• The greatest predictor of adherence
to an atypical antipsychotic existed
in youth who were taking another
psychotropic medication for a mood
symptoms, such as an

when the comparison level of alternatives exceeds the current
relationship, the likelihood increases that an individual will
leave the relationship (Thibaut & Kelley, 1959). Alternatives
that parents of children with ADHD utilized included
ﬁnding school programs and extracurricular activities that
matched the child’s needs as well as implementing a healthy
diet (Charach et al., 2006).

Clinical Implications
Clinicians can provide evidence-based psychosocial alternatives, health promotion, and case management strategies
that help meet families’ treatment needs for children with
psychiatric problems. Treatment alternatives such as behavioral therapy, parent management training, family therapy,
social skills training, anger management training, problem–
solving training, or cognitive behavioral therapy can be recommended in select psychiatric disorders where there is the
evidence to support these interventions to families so they
can make the most rational decision. For example, while
stimulant treatment is the most effective intervention for
ADHD, parent management behavioral therapy training is
viewed at the best nondrug intervention using rewards and
consequences to shape behaviors at home and in school
(Smith, Barkley, & Shapiro, 2006). Some research shows combined medication and psychosocial treatments are also a very
useful treatment for many psychiatric disorders in youth
(Arnold et al., 2003; Kennard et al., 2008) and should be recommended. However, in psychiatric disorders such as
ADHD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, medication
treatment is the ﬁrst line treatment. Nonvoluntary relationships refer to unsatisfactory relationships that remain stable
due to a lack of a better alternative (Thibaut & Kelley, 1959),
indicating that families may continue with medication treatment even though they do not value it due to lack of a better
alternative.

Clinician’s Role in Understanding Families’
Motivation for Psychiatric Treatment
According to social exchange theory, prediction comes
from understanding a person’s motivation (White & Klein,
2008). If mental healthcare providers want to understand
whether a family will initiate psychiatric treatment, they need
to explore the families’ motivation for treatment. In the therapeutic assessment process the prescriber obtains the family’s
knowledge of the psychiatric disorder, reason for referral,
and who initiated the appointment. The onset, etiology,
course, and prognosis of the disorder is obtained as well as
the family’s view of the problem. Assessment includes the
family’s previous attempts to treat the problem, goals for
treatment, and plans for treatment participation. An understanding of the family’s healthcare values, such as perceived
JCAPN Volume 23, Number 3, August, 2010

rewards, costs, and views of alternatives will need to be
obtained. The prescriber evaluates the family’s patterns of
reciprocity, decision making, dominance, control, dependence, and power within the social exchange framework
(Sabatelli & Shehan, 1993). Prescribers must understand that
each family member may differ in an understanding of the
illness and goals for treatment.
The power structure within the family will impact decisions the family makes about medication. In evaluating power
within the family system, Coleman (1990) states that the
minimal authority system consists of only two actors: superordinate and subordinate, which would be the parent and
child. A third party enters the system through resources. In
this case, the third party would be the prescriber recommending psychiatric treatment to the family. Coleman states “The
interest of the actors leads them to carry out exchanges that
redistribute the resources in the system” (p. 132). When a
second individual has control of resources relevant to the
well-being of the ﬁrst, the ﬁrst actor is dependent on the
second individual (Marsden, 1981). In this case the child is
dependent on their parent or guardian to obtain the appropriate psychiatric resources to treat their psychiatric problem.
Social exchange theory postulates that power is held by the
family member who contributes the greatest resources to the
family (Blau, 1964). Parents typically hold the most power in
the family to obtain psychiatric resources for their child. Thus,
if the parent values the treatment recommendations, it can
positively inﬂuence the child’s acceptance of treatment.
Younger children, who are more dependent on their parents,
may adopt their parent’s values, and accept their parent’s
decision-making authority. Hackworth and McMahon (1991)
evaluated factors mediating children’s healthcare attitudes
and found that children share similar beliefs towards healthcare as their mothers. Furthermore, younger children were
more inﬂuenced by their mother’s healthcare beliefs than
adolescents. Homans (1950) reported that persons who interact with one another more frequently were more alike in their
activities than those who interact less frequently. This frequent
interaction may also account for the inﬂuence of shared
healthcare attitudes.
Social exchange theory also describes that actors are motivated by self-interest (Coleman, 1990). If the child’s symptoms cause distress for the primary caregivers, such as
behavioral problems at home or school, school failure or
suspensions, missed work or social pressure from others for
their child to behave in a certain way, the primary caregivers
may be more motivated to seek services and treatment for
their child. The child taking the medication will also have an
important role in the decision to engage in medication treatment. Therefore, working with both parents or guardians and
the child will give the clinician the greatest knowledge of the
family’s power structure and how that will inﬂuence the
decision making process.

Pediatric Psychotropic Medication Initiation and Adherence: A Literature Review Based
on Social Exchange Theory

The Relationship Between the Family and
Medication Provider Effects Adherence
According to social exchange theory, the relationship
between individuals in a transaction has direct implications
for the value of the perceived exchange.

According to social exchange theory, the
relationship between individuals in a
transaction has direct implications for the
value of the perceived exchange.

Advanced practice nurses can have great inﬂuence in the
family’s decisions about treatment based on the therapeutic
alliance created. Chavira, Stein, Bailey, and Stein (2003) evaluated parents of children ages 8 to 17 with social anxiety from
pediatric primary care settings and found that that relationships with the provider impacted parent’s perceptions and
willingness to participate on both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
Pescosolido, Perry, Martin, McLeod, and Jensen (2007)
documented that establishing a relationship between the provider and parents may decrease stigma associated with treating child mental health problems. Holzinger et al. (2002)
found psychiatric medication compliance for schizophrenia
increased with a more positive helping alliance with the
provider. Researchers established that the relationship
between the patient and prescriber inﬂuenced the decision to
maintain or stop medication (Verbeek-Heida & Mathot,
2006).
According to social exchange theory, one only has authority if the other actor accepts the other’s contributions
(Homans, 1974). Therefore, the parent or prescriber may only
have authority over the child or adolescent’s decision to take
medication if the youth accepts the decision to take medication. Therefore, careful negotiation with both the parent and
child are imperative if the prescriber is trying to inﬂuence the
family to initiate or sustain medication treatment.
“How much conﬁdence an actor will place in a man they
have never seen before depends on how the man manipulates
a person’s perception of the chance of loss and gain”
(Coleman, 1990, p. 105). It is the prescriber’s role to inform the
family of both the beneﬁts and costs of medication treatment
and alternative treatment options and create a positive and
realistic perception of what treatment can do to reduce
unwanted psychiatric symptoms. Social exchange theory discusses the importance of trust such that social exchange is not
166

likely to occur unless social bonds rooted in trust have been
established and the exchange is seen as fair (Blau, 1964). The
prescriber must gain the family’s trust in order to persuade
them that the medication can produce the beneﬁts they are
seeking, especially if the family is receiving negative messages
or incorrect information from society or social supports about
psychopharmacological treatment. Social exchange emphasizes that changes in relationship patterns may take time to
achieve (Homans, 1974). As indicated in Berger et al.’s (2008)
medication study, it took parents 23.5 months after initiation
of treatment to accept the idea of medication treatment being
safe and efﬁcacious. The prescriber must also trust the family
to utilize the medication appropriately. Social exchange
theory acknowledges that trust involves putting resources in
the hands of parties who will use resources to their own
beneﬁt (Coleman, 1990). The prescriber must realize that they
are working not only with the child and parent’s own preconceived ideas, values, and judgments about mental illness and
treatments, but also with societal views on mental health and
medication as well as the family’s informal information
sources about mental illness and medication treatment.
Persuasive behavior from one person to another is part of
a social exchange. Persuasion is a wish for the other to act in
a particular way by rationalizing why it would be to the
other’s advantage to act in the desired manner (Homans,
1974). Individuals change their behavior due to the inﬂuence
of the other (Homans, 1974). Prescribers try to inﬂuence the
parent and child to initiate medication through education
about intended effects of the medication to decrease the
target symptoms. The prescriber transmits their knowledge
to the family about the neurobiological effects of medication,
medication dosing, beneﬁts, adverse effects, and the useful
duration of psychopharmacologic treatment for symptoms.
The prescriber takes into consideration the rates of effectiveness from randomized controlled trials, the child’s and family’s response history to psychiatric medications, and the
prescriber’s personal experience with other patients’ trials of
medications when making a medication recommendation.
The prescriber also utilizes evidence-based psychosocial
treatments as part of the child’s treatment plan. Collaboration
between the members of the family and the prescriber is the
goal of the treatment. Homans (1974) describes that the more
members are involved in the decision the more ideas are
generated and the greater investment in the outcome. The
prescriber transmits his/her knowledge to all the invested
family to equalize the power and engage the family in
owning the decision based on the use of their own knowledge to make a rational choice.
The prescriber must be adept at using problem solving
models including problem identiﬁcation, recognition, acceptance of the problem, and strategies for intervention. Motivational interviewing is another way to enhance commitment to
the treatment process. The prescriber will evaluate alternaJCAPN Volume 23, Number 3, August, 2010

tives that can result in achievement of a solution, generate
new solutions and then evaluate the responses of the
attempted solutions.
Power is usually a matter of negotiation, implicit or
explicit (Homans, 1974). While bargaining usually favors the
more powerful person, it may result in neither party agreeing
to change his behavior further (Homans, 1974). Even after the
prescriber has conveyed the information most persuasively,
the family may still choose to forgo the medication treatment.
This presents a dilemma for prescribers, as they may feel
helpless in facilitating intended symptom remission. This is
one of the most challenging dilemmas for prescribers in the
treatment of speciﬁc disorders like ADHD, bipolar disorder,
and schizophrenia, where the evidence supports medication
as the ﬁrst line treatment option yielding optimum symptom
remission. When medication is indicated, the prescriber can
continue to build a trusting relationship with the family in
the hope of persuading the trial of medication initiation or
continuation of medication at a later date, when the family is
ready to explore medication treatment options.

viduals will assume the same analytic ability, cognitive
ability, or resources; in fact, many of the studies excluded
patients if they had an IQ below 80. Also, children who are
taking medication did not demonstrate the same cognitive
understanding of the medication effects and side effects as
their adult mothers. Interestingly, the literature in this article
highlighted that even when individuals have all the accurate
information about medication treatment, this does not
directly inﬂuence adherence. While social exchange theory
does look at power within social relationships, it does not
account for factors such as age, ethnicity, and gender that
might be better accounted for in feminist theory or life course
developmental family theory. Bioecological models might
also better explain the interplay between the concepts of
stigma, relationship with the provider, education level of the
individuals, and environmental factors that are not
addressed in social exchange theory. In evaluating family
theories, the symbolic interactionalist framework would
incorporate issues of role, identity, and perceptions as they
relate to psychotropic medication adherence.

Limitations of the Literature

Potential Interventions to Promote Psychotropic
Treatment Adherence

Some of the studies included contained small sample
sizes limiting the generalizability of ﬁndings. Primary measures used to evaluate adherence were highly variable
ranging from qualitative interviews with parents to quantitative measures including saliva tests and serum levels,
making it difﬁcult to compare the results. Many of the qualitative studies did not use standardized speciﬁc adherence
measures, making it difﬁcult to make meaningful comparisons of adherence rates. The length of time used to measure
adherence and inclusion and exclusion criteria such as drug
holidays varied from study to study. The only child and adolescent psychiatric disorders that explored adherence rates in
the research were children with ADHD and bipolar disorder.
The majority of the studies on parent and child perceptions of
psychotropic medication were with children with ADHD.

Limitations of the Social Exchange Theory
Social exchange theory is a relevant framework to use
when assessing medication adherence with its emphasis on
costs, rewards, and alternatives; however, the theory does
have limitations for this speciﬁc area of study. The theory
does not take into account individual differences and
assumes anyone would make the same decision given the
identical information and situation. Families vary in their
experiences and values, cultural inﬂuences, access to
resources and mental healthcare beliefs, which can account
for differences in attitudes toward medications. A limitation
of the theory is that it proposes that individuals will make
rational decisions based on their analytic ability. Not all indiJCAPN Volume 23, Number 3, August, 2010

Social exchange theory postulates that the more an action
is rewarded, the more it will be performed (Homans, 1974).
Therefore, according to social exchange theory, if the child is
rewarded for taking medication it will have the effect of
increasing medication compliance behavior.
While rewards for taking psychotropic medications have
not been investigated, research on reward programs such as
a token system for medication compliance was evaluated in
children with insulin-dependent diabetes, demonstrating
rewards improved medication adherence (Epstein et al.,
1981).
Dilallo and Weiss (2009) suggest that motivational interviewing has potential to improve adolescents’ psychopharmacological adherence. The premise is that motivational
interviewing can enhance intrinsic motivation to change by
exploring and resolving ambivilance around the adolescent’s
view of their psychiatric illness and medication interventions. Channon et al. (2007) found motivational interviewing
did improve diabetes medication adherence with adolescents. These two interventions should be evaluated in psychiatric medication adherence studies.

Directions for Future Research
There are limited data on families’ perceptions of the costs
and beneﬁts of psychotropic medication. Qualitative studies
are needed to ascertain how families negotiate with one
another and their prescriber around the initiation and continuation of medication with a wider range of child and
167

Pediatric Psychotropic Medication Initiation and Adherence: A Literature Review Based

adolescent psychiatric diagnoses. To obtain more accurate
measures of adherence, biological evaluation measures such
as serum levels and saliva tests should be used, as there are
discrepancies between actual use and parent and child
report. There is also a need for a standardized parent/child
adherence measure with good reliability and validity.
Parents’ and children’s perceptions of the beneﬁts and costs
of psychotropic medications, values, attitudes, and beliefs
need to be articulated in more depth in the literature. Treatment acceptability, including families’ views of useful alternative treatments to medication, needs to be evaluated for
parents and children with psychiatric disorders. In most
studies, mothers’ views are obtained on perceptions of medication treatment, while very few studies evaluate fathers’
opinions of psychiatric treatment for their child. Parental
gender should be evaluated for its role in pediatric psychotropic treatment adherence. While behavioral rewards and
motivational interviewing have been successful in other
populations’ use of medication treatment, they need to be
evaluated for their effectiveness in the psychiatric pediatric
population. Children demonstrated decreased understanding of their medications compared with mothers, indicating
that psychoeducation may need to vary based on age and
cognitive ability and children’s knowledge of medication
needs to be formally evaluated as they are the recipients of
the treatment. Medication education has demonstrated
mixed results in terms of increased medication compliance,
indicating that interventions that target medication attitudes
and values, treatment alternatives, and the relationship with
the provider need to be evaluated in the research.

Conclusions
Social exchange theory provides a useful theoretical
framework for clinicians to explore psychotropic medication
treatment adherence and nonadherence for child and adolescent patients and their families. Social exchange theory
includes the premise that individuals will make decisions
based on maximizing rewards and minimizing costs and
exploring the best alternatives. This review provides clinicians with an understanding of families’ perceptions of costs,
rewards, and value on alternative psychosocial treatments as
it impacts medication adherence. While prescription rates for
most psychiatric drugs for children are increasing, medication adherence in child and adolescent psychiatric populations is a problem. Costs of untreated psychiatric problems
include longer duration of illness, greater intensity of symptoms, greater relapse rates, poorer academic performance,
safety risks, and increased interpersonal peer and family
problems. Beneﬁts of medication for psychiatric treatment in
youth include improved psychiatric symptoms, peer relationships, school performance, family relationships, and
reduced level of parenting stress.
168

Children and parents may not reap the beneﬁts of medication treatment due to perceived costs of medication treatment. Barriers identiﬁed by children, adolescents, parents
and researchers include adverse side effects, no response to
medication treatment, a positive response to treatment, social
stigma associated with medication, decreased parental experiences with mental illness, increased age of the child, lower
levels of parental education, less severe psychiatric impairment, loss of psychiatric symptoms if they were an integrated
part of one’s identity, general fears of medication as well as
speciﬁc fears of drug addiction, lack of knowledge of the
illness and course of treatment, conﬂictual parent–child relationships, being of a minority ethnicity, and poorer relationship with the prescriber. Clinicians should assess if families
have accurate information about medication and what role
social stigma may play in adherence. The research also highlights the importance of the prescriber to assess and help the
child and family with adjustment to psychiatric illness and
diagnosis as many youth felt they did not need medication.
Overall, children with comorbid psychiatric disorders have
higher psychotropic medication use; however, comorbidities
such as oppositional deﬁant disorder may interfere with
treatment compliance. Multiple daily dosing of the medication decreases adherence practices due to the complexity of
trying to remember each dose. Positive experiences that may
inﬂuence the perceived value of the medication include positive attributional cognitions towards medication, improved
psychiatric symptoms, school improvement, peer improvement, and a trusting relationship with the prescriber as
identiﬁed by researchers and children and families. While
researchers evaluated educational interventions impact on
adherence with outcomes of varying degrees of success, ﬁndings were that while many individuals understood the medication costs and beneﬁts, this knowledge did not result in
greater adherence. It appears attitudes toward medication
carry more weight in whether a child or family will actually
adhere to medication treatment for psychiatric symptoms. It
also appears that families place greater value on psychosocial
alternatives to treatment.

These factors can assist prescribers in having candid discussions with families about the cost and rewards of psychotropic treatment as well as explore evidence-based treatment
alternatives. Advanced practice psychiatric nurses are trained
to offer holistic care including psychopharmacological and
psychosocial treatments, case management, family therapy,
and health promotion and prevention strategies to promote
mental health in children, adolescents and their families.
