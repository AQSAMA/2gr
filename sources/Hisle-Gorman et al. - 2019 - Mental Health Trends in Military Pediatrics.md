Objective: Childhood psychiatric disorders affect current
functioning and predispose individuals to more severe adult
mental health problems. Provider survey research has suggested that children’s mental health problems are increasing;
observed changes may be due to increased illness or improved access to care. The authors sought to quantify trends
in the prevalence of diagnosed and treated mental health
conditions, outpatient treatment, and psychiatric medication prescriptions in a large population of children who were
continuously insured.

Results: From 2003 to 2015, the prevalence of children with
diagnosed mental health conditions increased from 9.2%
to 15.2% (rate ratio=1.04, 95% conﬁdence interval=1.04–
1.05, p,0.001). Identiﬁed suicidal ideation prevalence
increased by 20% a year. Mental health care visits increased
by 2% a year, and psychiatric medication prescriptions increased by 3% a year between 2003 and 2015, with larger
increases seen among older children. Prescriptions for
children with identiﬁed mental health conditions did not
increase.

Methods: The authors performed a retrospective trend
study of diagnosed mental health conditions, treatment,
and psychiatric medication prescriptions from 2003 to
2015 in children ages 2–18 who were military dependents
(N=1,798,530). Poisson regression analyses and CochranArmitage tests determined trends in the prevalence of treated
psychiatric diagnoses overall and by subcategory, rates of
outpatient mental health visits, and psychiatric medication
use overall and by speciﬁc class.

Conclusions: Diagnosed mental health conditions, pharmaceutical treatment, and outpatient visits all increased across
a diverse U.S. pediatric population from 2003 to 2015. Results suggest that use of psychiatric medications kept
pace with the increased number of diagnoses and that
older children are most affected.

Children’s psychiatric disorders affect child, family, and
community functioning and often persist into adulthood
with increased intensity (1, 2). Using national surveillance
systems and survey data, researchers have estimated that
11% to 20% of U.S. children have mental illnesses (3–7) and
that the number is increasing (8–11).
European population studies have documented increasing diagnosis and treatment of attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
bipolar disorder (8, 9). Provider surveys that compared U.S.
mental health visit rates in 1980s–1990s, 1995–1998, and
2007–2010 indicated increased psychiatric complaints and
visits for treatment (10–12). A recent representative survey
of U.S. households found mental health service use increased for youths ages 6–17 from 9.2% in 1996–1998 to
13.3% in 2010–2013 (13). Inpatient data have suggested pediatric mental health hospitalizations are increasing (14, 15)
but length of stay is decreasing (16). However, these studies
examined care provided overall, not speciﬁc diagnoses or
speciﬁc patients; results cannot determine whether patient
numbers, or number of visits for existing patients, are
increasing.

Studies also have suggested increased psychotropic
medication prescriptions (10, 11, 13, 17–19). U.S. provider
surveys have shown increased youth visits for prescription
of some psychotropic medication classes from 1995–1998
to 2007–2010 (10, 11). Household survey research has estimated that psychotropic prescriptions increased nationally
from 5.5% to 8.9% of children over the same period across
multiple medication classes (13). However, public insurance

HIGHLIGHTS

• Psychiatric diagnoses of children who were military dependents increased from 9.2% in 2003 to 15.5% in 2015.

• Psychiatric medication prescriptions for all included
children increased signiﬁcantly from 7.1% (2003) to 10.4%
(2015); however, the percentage of children with diagnosed
mental health conditions who were taking a psychiatric
medication (approximately 50%) did not change signiﬁcantly.

• For children with diagnosed mental health conditions, the
mean number of mental health care visits per year increased
from 6.3 to 8.0.

research has shown no increase in psychotropic prescriptions from 2004 to 2014 (20).
Reported increases may relate to increased population
prevalence, ease of diagnosis, or use of mental health care
and psychotropic medications related to improved mental
health care coverage (21, 22). Pediatric mental health trends
in a population of children with consistent health insurance
have not been reported, and previous studies of youth mental
health treatment have not included uncommon but severe
disorders (10, 23). Examinations of psychotropic medication
use have largely focused on numbers of visits with psychiatric prescriptions; parental report of medication use; children with public insurance at higher mental health–related
risk; speciﬁc psychotropics, such as antipsychotics; or speciﬁc diagnoses, such as autism or ADHD (10, 13, 20, 24–27).
Studies linking prescription billing data with diagnosed
mental health conditions across a large diverse population
have not been reported.
Children who are military dependents may be at increased risk of psychiatric disorders. Parental concerns
about a child’s psychological health as well as inpatient and
outpatient mental health care of children are known to increase during and after a deployment (28–31). Children with
a military parent have reported higher rates of depression,
suicidal ideation, suicide attempts (32, 33), and hospitalizations; however, data did not account for insurance coverage (34). Despite having access to high-quality health care,
youths with military connections may experience barriers to
care related to perceived stigma, conﬁdentiality concerns,
and military moves (35). Although soldiers have reported
decreased stigma and increased mental health care use over
time (36), use patterns of military-connected youths have not
be reported.
We sought to explore trends in treated psychiatric diagnoses, outpatient mental health care, and psychiatric medication prescriptions from 2003 to 2015 in youths with
military connections who had consistent comprehensive
health care and prescription medication coverage over the
course of the study (37).
METHODS
We performed a retrospective trend study of treated psychiatric diagnoses, treatment, and psychiatric medication
prescriptions by using the TRICARE Management Activity
Military Health System (MHS) database. This database records care provided to uniformed services members and
their dependents at military and civilian health care facilities
domestically and abroad. Civilian facilities provide more
than half of all care (28). Our population included all children who were ages 2 to 18 at the beginning of each year
from 2003 to 2015 and who were enrolled in the MHS for
11 or more months of that year. Included children were
family members of active duty troops, retirees, or National
Guard and Reserve troops in active roles; 11 months of required enrollment likely removed many children of National
658

Guard and Reserve troops who received MHS care only
during parental active duty service.
Mental health care visits were identiﬁed in the outpatient
record by ICD-9 diagnostic codes classiﬁed by Healthcare
Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Clinical Classiﬁcation
Software as mental health care. Visits for mental health care
were identiﬁed by HCUP subcategories for adjustment,
anxiety, attention-deﬁcit, conduct, and cognitive disorders;
disorders ﬁrst identiﬁed in childhood; impulse control, mood,
personality, and psychotic disorders; suicidal ideation; alcohol
use and substance use disorders; and miscellaneous mental
health conditions (dissociative, eating, and factitious disorders). Mental health subcategories for developmental delay
and screening were excluded. Children with one or more diagnoses for a given mental health category were categorized
as having that condition and as having a mental health condition within the year. Children could have more than one
subcategory of psychiatric diagnosis. All mental health visits
were counted for the given year. Means and medians of mental
health care visits were calculated, and trends were reported.
Data on psychiatric medication prescriptions were
extracted from the outpatient pharmacy record, which includes all outpatient prescription medication data. Prescriptions can be ﬁlled at military, civilian, or mail-order
pharmacies at low or no cost. Using the American Hospital
Formulary System, medications were sorted into the following therapeutic classes: stimulants, nonstimulant ADHD
medications, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and
mood stabilizers. Children with one or more psychiatric medication prescription were classiﬁed as using that class of
medication and using a psychiatric medication within the
year.
Chi-square analyses compared groups on the prevalence
of treated psychiatric disorders overall and mental health
subtypes. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to identify
signiﬁcant trends in psychiatric diagnoses overall and by
mental health subtype, outpatient mental health visits, and
psychiatric medication use overall and by class. The Poisson
regression was used to calculate prevalence rate ratios (RRs)
and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) to analyze trends over
the study period. Adjusted models accounted for child gender and parental rank. When clearly not linear, trend analyses were completed on smaller time segments. Analyses
were conducted by using Stata Intercooled, version 13;
p,0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. The study
was reviewed and approved by the responsible institutional
review boards.
RESULTS
An average of 1,798,530 children ages 2–18 received health
care each year in the MHS from 2003 to 2015, ranging from
1,738,856 (2015) to 1,873,549 (2010) children. On average,
8.9% of included children had a parent of junior-enlisted
rank (military rank of E-4 or below), ranging from 8.0% in
2006 to 10.4% in 2010. A slightly higher percentage of

children were boys; the
largest age group was children ages 6–13. Of children
with
diagnosed
mental
health conditions, 57%–60%
were male, and an average of
8% had a parent of juniorenlisted rank (Table 1).

Psychiatric Diagnoses
In 2003, 9.2% of included
children had a diagnosed
mental health condition; this percentage increased to 15.2%
of children in 2015. Over the 13-year period, the prevalence
of treated mental health conditions signiﬁcantly increased
by 4% per year (RR=1.04, 95% CI=1.04–1.05, p,0.001;
Table 2) in unadjusted analysis. ADHD and conduct
disorder diagnoses were the most common diagnosis,
affecting 5.1%–8.1% of children, followed by mood, adjustment, and anxiety disorders. The treated prevalence of diagnoses in each subcategory of mental health care increased
from 2003 to 2015, with the exception of alcohol-related
disorders. Prevalence of identiﬁed suicidal ideation increased the most, from 0.01% in 2003 to 0.53% in 2015, a 20%
increase (Table 2). Trends were fairly consistent across
gender, parental military rank, and age.
Mood, depressive, personality, psychotic, alcohol use,
substance use, and suicidal ideation diagnoses were more
than twice as common in children ages 14–18 compared
with children younger than age 13 (p,0.001 for all diagnostic categories in 2003 and 2015; results not shown).
Children ages 6–13 had the highest treated prevalence of
ADHD or conduct disorder diagnoses (p,0.001). Most
psychiatric diagnoses increased at a slightly higher rate
for children ages 14–18 (p,0.001), with the exception
of suicidal ideation, which increased at a slightly higher
rate for children ages 6–13 (RR=1.24, 95% CI=1.18–1.30,
p,0.001).
The percentage of children with a diagnosed mental
health condition was higher among boys than girls in 2003
(10.9% vs. 7.9%, p,0.001) and 2015 (17.1% vs. 13.2%,
p,0.001). In both 2003 and 2015, boys were signiﬁcantly
more likely to have disorders diagnosed in childhood
(p,0.001), ADHD (p,0.001), or impulse control disorders
(p,0.001). Girls were signiﬁcantly more likely to have diagnosed mood and depressive disorders (p,0.001) and suicidal ideation (p,0.001).
Mental Health Care
The total number of mental health care visits rose from
1,055,100 in 2003 to 2,148,451 in 2015. The number of mental health care visits per child per year was not normally
distributed. The mean number of visits per child with
a psychiatric diagnosis increased from 6.3 in 2003 to 8.0
visits per year in 2015, a 2% (p,0.001) increase per year in
Psychiatric Services 70:8, August 2019

unadjusted and adjusted analysis (Table 2); the median
remained consistent at three visits per year.
Psychiatric Medications
The percentage of all children who received a psychiatric
medication prescription increased signiﬁcantly from 7.1%
in 2003 to 10.4% in 2015, a yearly increase of 3.0% (RR=
1.03, p,0.001; Figure 1); the RR became nonsigniﬁcant after adjustment for demographic characteristics. In unadjusted
analysis, prescriptions for nonstimulant ADHD medications, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics, all signiﬁcantly increased for the population of children over the
course of the study (Figure 2). Prescriptions for mood stabilizers decreased, and stimulant prescriptions did not change
signiﬁcantly.
After the analysis was adjusted for demographic characteristics, it was shown that prescriptions of anxiolytics increased signiﬁcantly and prescriptions of antidepressants
and mood stabilizers decreased signiﬁcantly. Stimulant
prescriptions did not follow a linear trend (Figure 2); they
increased from 2003 to 2007 (RR=1.02, 95% CI=1.01–1.04,
p=0.001) and from 2008 to 2011 (RR=1.09, 95% CI=1.08–1.11,
p,0.001), but they did not signiﬁcantly increase from
2012 to 2015 (RR=1.18, 95% CI=0.95–1.45, p=0.13). Stimulants
were the most commonly prescribed class of medication,
with 2% to 5% of children having a prescription each year.
Stimulants, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics
all increased the most for children ages 14–18 (p,0.001).
Nonstimulant ADHD medications increased for children
ages 2–5 and ages 14–18 (p,0.001). Antipsychotics and antidepressants increased for children ages 6–13 (p,0.001).
Stimulant medication prescriptions increased for children with junior-enlisted parents but not for children
with parents who had senior military rank (p,0.001). All
medication prescription trends were consistent across gender.
For children with psychiatric diagnoses, psychiatric
medication prescriptions did not increase (53.8% of children in 2003 vs. 52.6% of children in 2015: RR=0.99,
95% CI=0.97–1.01, p=0.29; adjusted RR [ARR]=0.98, 95%
CI=0.96–1.00, p=0.42; Figure 1). Prescription data were not
linear; two time periods showed a small statistically signiﬁcant increase in prescriptions (2008–2011: RR=1.01, 95%
CI=1.01–1.01, p,0.001; 2012–2015: RR=1.01, 95% CI=1.01–1.01,

p,0.001). The period from 2003 to 2007 did not show any
signiﬁcant changing trend.
For children with psychiatric diagnoses, in unadjusted
analysis, anxiolytic prescriptions signiﬁcantly increased,
and mood stabilizer prescriptions signiﬁcantly decreased
(Figure 3). After adjustment, prescriptions for antipsychotics (ARR=1.07, p,0.001) and anxiolytics (ARR=1.04,
p,0.001) increased signiﬁcantly, and stimulants decreased (ARR=0.98, 95% CI=0.96–1.00, p,0.05); however,
stimulant prescriptions did not follow a linear trend.
For children with diagnosed mental health conditions,
stimulant prescriptions increased for children with juniorenlisted parents but not for children with parents who had
senior military rank. Antidepressant prescriptions decreased
for children ages 2–5 but not for older children. Anxiolytics
increased for children ages 6–18 (p,0.001) but not for
younger children.

DISCUSSION
We found that between 2003 and 2015, the percentage of
military-connected children with a diagnosed psychiatric
diagnosis increased signiﬁcantly (9.2% vs. 15.2%), as did
mean health care visits per year (6.3 vs. 8.0) and the percentage of children prescribed a psychiatric medication (7.1% vs. 10.0%). However, psychiatric medication
prescriptions did not increase in children with diagnosed
mental health conditions. Medication increases were largely
in older children.
This research indicates an increasing trend in children’s
psychiatric diagnoses over 13 years. The treated prevalence
in our population is lower than reported estimates of 13% to
20% of U.S. children for 2005–2011 (3, 7, 13). This percentage
of children with psychiatric diagnoses may be lower than
national estimates because of study methods requiring a

psychiatric diagnosis, inclusion of children as young as age 2,
the fact that military pediatrics skew toward younger children (38), and possible military-related stigma surrounding
seeking care (35). Results mirror previously reported trends
of increased psychiatric diagnoses in children (10, 13) with
consistent health insurance coverage.
This study period fell entirely during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; increased mental health care and psychiatric medication use of military-connected children is
consistent with research linking parental wartime deployment and child mental health care needs (28, 29).
However, mirroring nationally reported trends (10, 13), diagnosed mental health conditions increased consistently
without marked upsurges in periods of high-intensity combat deployments in 2007–2008 and 2010–2012 (39, 40).
Consistent increases in mental health care and psychiatric medication prescriptions, without marked upsurges at
times of increased military deployment, suggest that parental deployment did not drive increased psychiatric diagnoses and care or that effects of deployment and military
life signiﬁcantly affected ongoing mental health risk. Findings may also be related to the enactment of the 2011 mental
health care provision in military schools (41), although the
late initiation date and the fact that 80% of military children
attend public schools (42) suggests that school programs do
not fully explain the results. National efforts to support
primary care providers through telemedicine and links to
specialty providers may also contribute to outcomes, given
that primary care providers’ comfort with diagnoses and
treatment of children’s mental health conditions may have
increased during the study period.

Of all subcategories of psychiatric diagnoses, suicidal
ideation increased the most: a 20% per year increase over
the time period, a 40% increase in adjusted analysis, and a
24% increase for children ages 6 to 13. This study did not
identify deaths by suicide, yet ﬁndings of increases in diagnosed suicidal ideation in this study are consistent with
increasing rates of suicide among children and youths reported elsewhere (43). Consistent with research on the
prevalence of suicidal ideation among young people in
clinical settings, we found that the identiﬁed prevalence of
suicidal ideation was almost twice as common among girls
as among boys (44). Increased use of HEADSS (Home &
Environment, Education & Employment, Activities, Drugs,
Sexuality, Suicide/Depression) interviewing, stronger U.S.
preventive task force recommendations, use of the Patient
Health Questionnaire–9 (Adolescent), and increased militarywide attention to depression and suicide may suggest
that the increases are related to identiﬁcation.
Mean mental health care visits rose 2% per year in unadjusted and adjusted analyses from 6.3 to 8.0 visits per child
per year. The median number of visits did not increase.
Results suggest that increases in outpatient care are driven
by severe cases; trends toward decreased inpatient child
mental health care may support this ﬁnding (16). Although
this study did not examine the care provision site, a known
dearth of military mental health providers (45) suggests that
a substantial portion of care was provided outside the military, indicating that civilian providers need to be aware of
issues surrounding military life.
In our population of nearly 2 million children a year,
we found that the percentage of all children prescribed

psychiatric medications rose from 7% to 10% and stayed at
about 50% for children with diagnosed mental health conditions. Previous studies reporting increased psychiatric
medication use by U.S. children have not controlled for
confounders and have not examined rates among children
with and without psychiatric diagnoses (10, 11, 23). Our
ﬁndings are at odds with one U.S. study indicating that use of
psychiatric medications by children who were publicly insured did not increase from 2004 to 2014 (20). However, our
ﬁndings mirror population-level research in Europe indicating increased psychiatric medication prescriptions
overall and consistent psychiatric medication use rates in
children with psychiatric diagnoses (17–19).
The results of this study are consistent with U.S. provider
survey research indicating that an increased number of pediatric visits include psychiatric medication prescriptions
(10, 11, 23); the ﬁndings are also consistent with parent
surveys showing an increasing percentage of children using
psychiatric medications (13). The results suggest that reported increases are related to increased diagnosis of mental
health conditions, not an increased medication burden in
children with preexisting diagnoses. Psychiatric medication
prescriptions for all children and for children with psychiatric diagnoses decreased from 2008 to 2012. This decline is
likely due to the black box warnings on ADHD medications
in 2007 and on antidepressants in 2004 (46, 47).
Anxiolytic prescriptions increased, and those for mood
stabilizers decreased, for all children and for children with
psychiatric diagnoses. Antipsychotic prescriptions increased
for all children, and for those with psychiatric diagnoses.
Nonstimulant ADHD medications and antidepressants

prescriptions increased for the full population but not for
children with diagnosed conditions. Increases may be related to the rise in polypharmacy in the treatment of mental
health conditions (48, 49). Decreases in mood stabilizer
prescriptions may relate to the movement toward using
anticonvulsants (which were not included in this analysis)
to treat mood disorders (50). Psychiatric medications increased the most in older children with all classes of
medication—with the exception of mood stabilizers and
nonstimulant ADHD medications—increasing more for youth
ages 14–18 than for younger children.
In the full population of children, only use of nonstimulant ADHD medications increased in the youngest age
group, and use of antipsychotics and antidepressants increased in school-age children. Increased medication use
mirrors the increasing diagnosis of mental health conditions
in older children. Stimulant ADHD medications increased
signiﬁcantly in children of junior-enlisted parents; increases
were evident in those with and without mental health conditions. Finding are inconsistent with research indicating
decreased medication for children with ADHD during parental deployment and decreased medication use for children of junior-enlisted parents (51); however, the results
are consistent with studies indicating increased stress
burden in junior-enlisted service members (52, 53), given
that child and parental mental health have been linked (54).
This study had several limitations. It was limited by reliance on ICD-9 coding, which is dependent on providers
correctly coding visits. Use of ICD-9 codes also made it
impossible to assess the severity of mental health conditions,
although the use of codes in claims data ensured that care

needs rose to clinical signiﬁcance. We were also unable to
identify providers who made diagnoses and prescribed
medications. The large number of included children and
nature of a trend study did not allow for identiﬁcation of risk
factors associated with increasing psychiatric diagnoses,
including the impact of parental deployment. However,
the fact that percentages of psychiatric diagnoses in our
population mirrored national estimates suggests parental
deployment does not fully explain the increasing treated
prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses.
Strengths of this study include a long 13-year time period
and a large population of children who received consistent,
high-quality medical and mental health care as well as free
or no cost prescription medications, which decreased ascertainment and sampling biases. Previous studies of U.S.
children have relied on compiling adjacent years to overcome small sample sizes. Our large population allowed us to
look at numbers year by year, permitting a closer examination of visit and medication trends. Because prescription
data were linked with individual children, we were able to
explore medication trends in the total population and in
children with diagnosed mental health conditions.
CONCLUSIONS
Diagnosed mental health conditions, pharmaceutical treatment, and outpatient visits increased for all children from
2003 to 2015. Results may relate to primary care providers’
increased comfort with identiﬁcation and treatment of
mental health conditions, increased monitoring and identiﬁcation, or increased mental health care need. Increases
appear most pronounced among adolescents ages 14 to 18,
suggesting that middle and high school children should
be more closely monitored for the development of mental
health conditions.
