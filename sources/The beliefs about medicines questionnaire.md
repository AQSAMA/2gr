This paper presents a novel method for assessing cognitive representations of medication: the Beliefs about
Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ). The BMQ comprises two sections: the BMQ-Specific which assesses representations of medication prescribed for personal use and the BMQ-General which assesses beliefs about mcdicines in general. The pool of test items was derived from themes identified in published studies and from
interviews with chronically ill patients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the test items resulted in a logically coherent. 18 item, Cfactor structure which was stable across various illness groups. The BMQSpecific
comprises two Sitem factors assessing beliefs about the necessity of prescribed medication (Specific-Necessity)
and concerns about prescribed medication bascd on beliefs about the danger of dependence and long-term toxicity and the disruptive effects of medication (Specific-Concern). The BMQGeneral comprises two Citem factors assessing beliefs that medicines are harmful, addictive, poisons which should not be taken continuously
(Geneml-Horn) and that medicines arc overused by docton (General-Overure). The two sections of the BMQ
can be used in combination or separately. The paper describes the development of the BMQ scales and presents
data supporting their reliability and their criterion-related and discriminant validity.

INTRODUCTION
The prescription of a medicine is the most common treatment intervention and accounts
for the largest single commodity source of health expenditure in most developed
economies. However, it is estimated that approximately 30-5096 of prescribed medication is not taken as directed (Meichenbaum and Turk, 1987) and non-adherence to medication is seen as a significant challenge to research and practice within the health care
domain (Home, 1993; Howitz and Horwitz. 1993). Various social cognition models
(SCMs) such as the Health Belief Model (HBM: Rosenstock, 1974). the Theory of
Reasoned Action (TRA: Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980) and its revision the Theory of

Planned Behaviour (TPB: Azjen, 1985), have been used to explain variation in medication adherence. This research shows that medication non-adherence may be the result of a
rational decision by the patient and identifies some of the cognitions which are salient to
these decisions. Although the specific type of beliefs which are associated with adherence
varies across studies, certain cognitive variables included in SCMs appear to be prerequisites of adherence in some situations (Home and Weinman, 1998). For example, beliefs
that failure to take the treatment could result in adverse consequences and that one is personally susceptible to these effects tends to be associated with higher adherence rates
(e.g. Cummings et al., 1981; Kelly et al., 1987). Additionally, adherence decisions may
be influenced by a cost-benefit analysis in which the benefits of treatment are weighted
against the perceived barriers (e.g. Brownlee-Duffeck et al., 1987; Cummings e f al.,
1981). Other studies, based on the TRA/TPB have shown that the perceived views of significant others such as family, friends and doctors (normative beliefs) may also influence
adherence (Cochran and Gitlin, 1988; Ried and Christensen, 1988; Ried et al., 1985).
Leventhal’s self-regulatory model of illness (SRM) (Leventhal et al., 1980; Leventhal
and Cameron, 1987) has also been applied to the study of medication adherence. In the
SRM the decision about whether or not to take medication is conceptualised as one of a
number of possible procedures for coping with an illness threat (Leventhal et al., 1997).
Adherence will be more likely if the patient perceives that the advice to take medication
makes ‘common-sense’, in the light of their experiences (e.g. past illness and/or current
symptoms) and their personal beliefs about the illness (Leventhal et al., 1992). In addition to providing an explanatory framework for how beliefs and behaviour are related,
self-regulatory theory postulates the types of beliefs which underpin illness cognitions
suggesting that the selection of a coping procedure, e.g. to seek (or not to seek) medical
advice or to take (or not to take) medication, is guided by beliefs about the nature, duration, causes, consequences and potential for cundcontrol of the illness.
It has been suggested that representations of treament may also play a role in self-regulation and that the explanatory power of SCMs in relation to medication adherence may
be enhanced by assessing patients’ beliefs about medication. Decisions about taking medication are likely to be informed by beliefs about medicines as well as beliefs about the
illness which the medication is intended to treat or prevent (Home, 1997). This principle
is recognised in a recent report from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain
which has identified the role of medication beliefs in treatment adherence as a priority for
future research (Marinker, 1997; Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, 1997).
Several qualitative studies have shown that people have beliefs about medicines in
general (e.g. Britten, 1994; Fallsberg, 1991 and Lorish et al., 1990). as well as beliefs
about medication prescribed for specific illnesses such as epilepsy (Conrad, 1985) and
hypertension (Morgan and Watkins, 1988). Moreover, certain representations of medicines appear to be common across several illness and cultural groups. However, a systematic comparison of findings is hampered by the fact that the few studies which have
quantitatively assessed medication beliefs have used different questionnaires (Woller
et al., 1993; Echabe et al., 1992) or have investigated medication beliefs in the broader
context of views about the practice of medicine (Marteau, 1990). Furthermore, some
studies have assessed peoples’ ideas about medicines in general (General beliefs)
whereas others have focused on specific medication prescribed for a particular illness
(Specific beliefs).
A review of the existing literature on lay beliefs about medicines raises three key questions (Home, 1997). The first relates to the nature of medication beliefs and whether the

BELIEFS ABOUT MEDICINES QUESTIONNAIRE

range of specific and general medication beliefs can be summarised into ‘common themes’
which are relevant across illness and cultural groups. A second question relates to the distribution of these beliefs (who holds them and how strongly are they held?). Finally, there
is the question of how representationsof medicine relate to each other (e.g. general vs. s pe
cific) and to illness beliefs. as well as to adherence behaviours. We believe that there is
need for a psychometrically sound method for operationalisingand scoring commonly held
beliefs about medication in order to systematicallyaddress the above questions. This paper
describes the development of a questionnaire-based method for assessing beliefs about
Specific and General medication, the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (Section 1)
and presents a preliminary evaluation of its psychometric properties (Section 2).
SECTION 1: DEVELOPMENT OF THE BELLEFS ABOUT
MEDICINES QUESTIONNAIRE (BMQ)

PARTICIPANTS
A Chronic Illness sample (n=524), comprising asthmatic, diabetic and psychiatric
patients from hospital clinics and cardiac, general medical and renal (haemodialysis
recipients) in-patients. The six illness groups from which patients were sampled were
chosen to reflect a variety of disease and treatment characteristics. Patients were included
if they had been prescribed one or more medicines for regular use in the treatment of their
illness for at least two months prior to the study and if they could read and understand the
questionnaire and felt well enough to complete it. Ethical committee approval was granted
for the study in each of the participating clinics and hospitals. The characteristics of the
main sample are shown in Table 1 and the individual illness samples are described in
more detail below.
The Asrhmaric sample (n =78) comprised consecutive asthmatic patients attending the
weekly out-patient clinics of two consultant respiratory physicians at a general hospital in

Brighton. UK, during a 3-month period between March and May 1994. Of 105 asthmatic
patients on the clinic schedule 17 refused to take part in the study, 9 did not attend the
clinic and one who agreed to take part subsequently withdrew without completing the
questionnaire. Seventy-eight patients entered the study and completed the clinic questionnaire giving an overall response rate 78/105 =74.3%. The mean duration of asthma was
1.6 years (SD = 1.3).
The Diabetic sample ( n = 99) comprised consecutive attenders at a diabetic out-patient
review clinic in a London general hospital. In a six week period, during April and May
1994, 124 study-eligible patients were approached and 20 refused to take part. Five of the
104 questionnaires returned were rejected ( > 10% of responses to questionnaire statements were missing or illegible) giving a final completion rate of 79.8%. Sixty four
(64.7%) of the patients were insulin-treated while the remaining patients received oral
hypoglycaemic medication.
The Renal sample (n=47) was recruited from the renal unit at a London Teaching
Hospital. Patients were randomly selected from the dialysis list and evaluated for entry
into the study until a target sample of approximately half of the 103 patients on the hospital haemodialysis list were recruited. Of 59 randomly selected study-eligible patients,
47 agreed to take part and completed the questionnaire giving a response rate of 79.7%.
The mean duration of dialysis treatment was 4.5 years (SD=4.9).
The Psychiatric sample (n = 89) was recruited as part of an audit evaluating a medicines-information service at a hospital psychiatric out-patient clinic in Brighton, UK. Of
118 patients who were eligible for inclusion in the present study, 27 failed to attend the
‘research clinic’ and a further two patients were omitted because they did not legibly
complete over 90% of the questionnaire items. The final study sample therefore comprised 89 patients giving a response rate of 78.4%. The mean duration of psychiatric illness was 10.2 years (SD= 8.4).
The Cardiac and General Medical inpatient samples ( n = 120; n =91 respectively) were
recruited from general medical wards of two London teaching hospitals and five district
general hospitals in London and Brighton, over an 8 week period between January and
March, 1995. Of 254 study-eligible patients, 37 refused to take part and 217 entered in the
study. Six of the questionnaires were rejected ( > 10% of responses to questionnaire statements were missing or illegible). The remaining 211 questionnaires were retained for
analysis. The fmal completion rate was therefore 2 11/254= 83.1 %. On the basis of primary
diagnosis the sample comprised chronic cardiac disease (56.8%). chronic respiratory diseases (16.2%), gastro-intestinal disorders (10.9%). diabetes (9.9%), cancer (3.8%) and
epilepsy (2.4%). Patients with chronic cardiac disease were considered as a single illness
group and the remaining patients ( n = 91) were grouped together as the ‘General medical
inpatients’.

METHOD
Rationale and Ovewiew

The BMQ was intended to assess commonly-held beliefs about medicines. The primary
task was to simplify the fairly broad range of beliefs which people hold about Specific
and General medication into ‘core themes’ which could then be evaluated as psychometric scales. The BMQ scales were derived from a pool of items representing commonly held beliefs about medication (see below for details) using exploratory Principal

Components Analysis (PCA). Specific and General medication beliefs were analysed
separately. The factor structures obtained were then tested in three ways. Confirmatory
factor analysis (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1993) was used to verify the factor structure. The
stability of the factor structure across chronic illness groups was tested by investigating
whether the factor structure obtained by exploratory PCA in one illness group was replicated in other illness groups. Finally, to confirm the validity of separating Specific and
General medication beliefs, items loading on the Specific and General factors identified
by PCA were combined and subjected to a further FCA. A high degree of separation
between general and specific items would indicate that patients made clear distinctions
between specific and general medication and justify the division of the BMQ into
Specific and General components.
Item Pool

A pool of 34 statements representing commonly held beliefs about specific (n= 16) and
general medication (n = 18) was obtained by selecting beliefs identified in the literature
which appeared to be common to patients with a range of chronic illnesses and from
interviews we conducted with 35 patients receiving regular medication for chronic illness
(20 haemodialysis patients and 15 patients with myocardial infarction). In these interviews patients were asked open questions eliciting their views about medicines prescribed for them and their thoughts about medicines in general in an attempt to identify
common beliefs which had not emerged in previous studies. The final pool of 34 items,
together with their origin. is shown in Table 2. Twelve items were positive statements
about medicines (e.g. ‘Without medicines doctors would be less able to cure people’) and
the remaining 22 items focused on negative (e.g. ‘Most medicines are addictive’) or neutral aspects (e.g. ‘Medicines only work ifthey are taken regularly’). This balance of items
reflects that observed in the literature (e.g. Britten. 1994; Donovan and Blake, 1992;
Fallsberg. 1991 and Lorish et al., 1990, Morgan and Watkins, 1988; Conrad, 1985) and
in interviews with patients. Responses to each statement were scored on a 5-point
Liken scale (where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 =uncertain, 4 =strongly agree
and 5 =strongly agree) and subjected to PCA as described below. Although the psychiamc and diabetic samples received identical General items as the other illness groups, the
Specific item pool differed by one item in the case of the psychiatric sample and two
items for the diabetic sample. This was done in order to reflect issues which were perceived to be pertinent to these groups. For the psychiatric sample the item ‘Without my
medicines I would be very ill’ was replaced by ‘Only my medicines can control my mental
health problems’. For the diabetic sample the items ‘My life would be impossible without
my medicines’ and ‘My medicines protect me from becoming worse’ were replaced by the
items ‘My medication controls my diabetes’ and ‘My medication prevents my blood sugar
from becoming too high’. For this reason, the derivation of the BMQ-Specific scales was
based on data from the asthmatic, cardiac, renal and general medical in-patient groups
which had received identical Specific items.

PROCEDURE
Each participant was invited to take part in a study of patients’ views about their illness
and treatment, The investigators stressed that the study was being conducted by the

It was hoped that this would encourage participants to respond in a way which represented their own views rather than those which they considered to be socially desirable

(Abraham and Hampson, 19%) and so avoid any response bias which might have resulted
if patients had associated the researcher with the clinical team. Participants were presented with the 34 item pool as described above at the same time as a battery of questionnaires assessing other relevant constructs as described in Section 2 below. These
measures (e.g. reported adherence and beliefs about illness) were included to assess the
criterion-related validity of the BMQ and were chosen on the basis of hypothesised relations with medication beliefs. The instructions to participants, are shown in the
Appendix. Clinic patients were asked to complete the questionnaire while waiting to see
the doctor. Patients recruited from hospital wards were asked to complete the study questionnaire by the researcher who then arranged to collect it at a convenient time.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA was conducted using the non-orthogonal (Direct Oblimin) method of rotation as recommended by mine (1 994) and CatteU (1 995). Cases with missing data were deleted listwise and items w e n omitttd on the basis of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic for
each item (item omitted if KMO < 0.7), factor scree plot and final factor loading as recommended by Norusis (1992). In order to eliminate the influence of multi-dimensional

outliers, items retained within the final factor structure were “cleaned” by removal of
multivariate outliers (Mahalanobis distance > 3 standard deviations from the mean) and
removal of cases with greater than five missing items (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1993).
Selecting Items for the BMQ Scales Using Exploratory PCA

The exploratory PCA of Specific beliefs about medicines prescribed for personal use was
performed on responses to the 16 items representing beliefs about prescribed medication
(Specific),shown in Table 2 above. The responses from the cardiac sample (n = 120) were
analysed first. The rationale for choosing a single diagnostic group was that patients with
one illness might receive very different medication from those with another and this
might influence representational structures. We could not assume that patients with different illnesses would have similar ideas about their medication. Rather, our goal was to
identifj a simple factor structure for a single diagnostic group and then to test whether
this structure was stable across other illness groups. The cardiac sample was chosen for
initial analysis on the grounds that it was the single largest diagnostic group within the
main sample.
The rationale for limiting initial exploratory factor analysis of specific items to a single
illness group did not apply to beliefs about medicines in general. Here, the aim was to
explore representations of medication as a broad concept, rather than beliefs which might
be unique to a particular illness group. In an attempt to obtain a factor structure which
was representative of patients with a range of chronic illnesses. data obtained from three
diagnostic groups (asthmatic, diabetic and renal) were amalgamated and subjected to an
exploratory PCA. The reason for selecting these particular diagnostic groups for combination was that the cardiac and general hospital samples were derived from the same population of hospital in-patients. Data were combined in order to investigate the themes
underlying beliefs about medicines in general which would be common across chronic
illness populations. Thus combining the cardiac and general medical inpatient samples
may have reduced the ‘scope’ of the sample.

Testing the Factor Structure Derived from Exploratory PCA
Confirmatoryfactor analysis was performed by computing Pearson’s correlations for factor loadings against a theoretical model of the predicted factor loadings (Tabachnick and
Fidell, 1993). The theoretical model was defined by assigning a factor a loading of ’1* to
In
all items expected to load on the factor. All other items were assigned a loading of ‘0’.
this way, the expected pattern of loadings could be compared with that derived from the
comparison groups.
The stability of the factor structure obtained for Specific beliefs in the cardiac group
was tested by a further series of PCA on the responses to factor items obtained from the
asthmatic, renal and general medical inpatient samples. The stability of the factor structure for General medication beliefs obtained from the amalgamated data set (asthmatic,
diabetic, renal samples) was tested by investigating the extent to which the structure
could be replicated when the factor items were entered in 3 separate PCAs using data
from the individual cardiac, general medical and psychiatric samples.
The separation of specific and General items was tested by a further PCA of the combined items loading on the factors identified by exploratory PCA. This analysis was performed on pooled data from all six illness groups ( n = 524). PCA was performed using
non-orthogonal (Direct Oblimin) rotation and setting a 4-factor solution as suggested by
factor scree plot.

RESULTS
Exploratory PCA
Specific beliefs. The mean and SD for each of the 16 items eliciting beliefs about prescribed medication administered to the Cardiac sample are shown in Table 3.
Four items with KMO values cO.7 were omitted. Factor scree plot analysis suggested a
2-factor solution explaining 5 1% of the variance. Having arrived at a core structure of two
5-item factors the data set was cleaned by removal of multivariate outliers (Mahalanobis
distance > 3 standard deviations from the multi-dimensional mean) and removal of cases
with greater than five missing items. This resulted in omission of 6 cases. Re-factoring on
the 114 remaining cases produced a similar two factor structure explaining 53% of the
variance.
Factor labels. The final 2-factor structure is shown in Table 4. The first factor comprised
items relating to the positive effect of medication on health and were representative of the
perceived necessity of medication for maintaining health. This factor was labelled
Specific-Necessity. The second factor comprised items relating to concerns about the
adverse consequences of medication based on beliefs about the potential for dependence
or harmful long-term effects and that medication taking is disruptive. This factor was
labelled Specific-Concerns.
General beliefs. The mean and standard deviation for scores on each of the 18 items eliciting beliefs about medicines in general are shown in Table 3. Elimination of six items
with a low KMO statistic (<0.7) and setting a two factor solution as suggested by scree
plot analysis, followed by elimination of a further 4 items with low or diffuse loading
resulted in two 4-item factors shown in Table 5 .

Statements about medicines in general (General)

Without medicines doctors would be less able to cure people
Newer medicines are more effective than older ones
Most medicines are addictive
People who take medicines should stop their treatment for
a while every now and again
Medicines only work if they are taken regulary
Medicines do more harm than good
Medicines are not natural remedies
All medicines arc poisons
It is better to d o without medicines
Natural remedies are safer than medicines
Stronger medicines are mom dangerous than weaker medicines
Medicines are a necessary evil
Doctors place too much trust in medicines
If doctors had more time with patients they would prescribe fewer medicines
Then: is a big difference between a medicine and a drug
The medicine you get is more important than the doctor you see
Doctors use too many medicines
Most medicines are safe

The first factor comprised items expressing beliefs about the way in which medicines
are used by doctors. The essence of this factor, labelled General-Overuse is the notion
that medicines are over-prescribed by doctors who place too much trust in them. The second factor, labelled General-Harm concerns the potential of medication to harm and
comprises representations of medication as harmful, addictive, poisons and the belief that
people who take medicines should stop their treatment every now again.

Replication of factor strucfure. The 2-factor structure for Specific beliefs was replicated
by PCA of the responses to the 10 items obtained from asthmatic. renal and general medical inpatient samples. Although there were minor differences in factor loadings, the factor structure obtained for each of the samples contained identical items. The 2-factor
structure obtained for General beliefs by exploratory PCA of combined data from the
asthmatic, diabetic and renal samples was replicated in the cardiac, and psychiatric samples, indicating acceptable stability of the factor structures across illness groups. PCA of
the data from the General Medical in-patients, produced a similar factor structure. with
the exception of one item: “Natural remedies are safer than medicines” which had
migrated from factor 1 to factor 2.
PCA of combined Specific and Generalfactor item. PCA of pooled data from all 6 illness
samples showed a clear separation of Specific and General items. A 4-factor structure was
obtained (see Table 8) which closely resembled the original Specific and General factor
structures except that one item from the Specific-Concernsfactor ‘My medicines are u mystery to me’, loaded a little higher on the General Harm (0.55) than on Specific-Concerns
(0.39). Removal of the General Medical Inpatient sample from the data set followed by a
further PCA on pooled data from the discreet diagnostic groups (asthmatic, diabetic, renal,
cardiac and psychiatric) replicated the original Specific and General factor structures.

SECTION 2: EVALUATION OF THE PSYCHOMETRIC
PROPERTIES OF THE BMQ
PARTICIPANTS
1. The Chronic Illness sample (n = 524), described in Section 1 above.
2. A matched group of patients seeking care from allopathic (community pharmacy) and
complimentary sources (homeopathyherbal clinic). This sample was recruited in
order to compare medication beliefs of allopathic and complementary care seekers.
The Allopathic Care sample were recruited from a community pharmacy during weekday evenings over a four week period between January and February 1996. Consecutive patients presenting a prescription at a community pharmacy were approached
by the researcher while they were waiting for the prescription to be dispensed.
One hundred and twenty six study-eligible patients were approached, 22 refused to
take part and 104 patients entered the study and returned completed questionnaires

( > 90% items answered legibly). The response rate for the Allopathic Care sample was
therefore 104/126 = 83%. The Complementary Care sample were recruited from the
clinics of a single herbalist and single homeopath, in Brighton, during the same time
period as the Allopathic Care sample. Both practitioners felt that it would be inappropriate to base a researcher in the clinic and so patients were invited to take part in the
study by the herbalist/homeopath. Those who agreed were asked to fill out the questionnaire and return it to the author at the University of Brighton in the stamped
addressed envelope provided. Fifty-four questionnaires were given out and 36 completed questionnaires were returned. The final response rate for the Complementary
Care sample was therefore 36/53 = 67.9%.

Matched samples. Seventy two participants were matched for age and sex and educational experience. Patients from the Allopathic Care sample were selected to match the
age and gender profile of the Complementary Care group. Matching was canied out
because of the large disparity in group sizes and the possible confounding effect of age
and gender. The characteristics of the matched samples are shown in Table 9.
There were no significant differences between Allopathic and Complementary samples in
terms of age, and gender. The Complementary Sample had significantly greater educational

practitioners in the 6 months prior to the study than had the Allopathic Care sample. There
were no significant Werences between the samples in the number of reported visits to
NHS General Practitioners or hospital admissions. The latter finding was interpreted as an
indicator that the samples were comparable in terms of illness severity.

MEASURES
The Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) (Weinman et al., 19%). The IPQ comprises
five scales measuring the five components of illness representation specified in
Leventhal’s self-regulatory model of illness (Leventhal et al., 1980). The five scales
assess identify (the symptoms the patient associates with the illness), cause (personal
ideas about aetiology), time line (the perceived duration of the illness), consequences
(expected effects and outcome), and curelcontrol (beliefs about potential for cure and
control of the illness). The psychometric properties of the IPQ have been evaluated in
7 patient groups including asthmatic, diabetic and hospital haemodialysis recipients and
the internal consistency, test-retest reliability and the concurrent, discriminant and predictive validity of the IFQ scales are within acceptable limits (Weinman et al., 1996).
Reported Adherence to Medication (RAM) scale. Published adherence self-report scales
were thought to be unsuitable because they are not specific to medication (DiMatteo
et al., 1993; Kravitz et al., 1993) or because they do not elicit self-report of the frequency of adjusting or altering dosages (Morisky, 1986). A reported adhecence to medication scale (RAM)was therefore devised for the present study. Non-adherence was
indicated by the tendency to forget to take medication and to deliberately adjust or alter
the dose from that recommended by the physician. The RAM scale comprises four
adherence statements. Two items (‘I sometimes forget to take my medicines’ and
‘I sometimes alter the dose of my medication to suit my own needr’) are scored on a
5-point Likert scale with reverse scoring (where 1 =strongly agree; 2 = agree; 3 = uncertain;4 =disagree and 5 =strongly disagree). A further two items (‘Somepeople forget to
take their medicines. How often does this happen to you?’ and ‘Somepeople I have talked
to say that they miss out a dose of their medication or adjust it to suit their own needr.
How ojien do you do this?’) are phrased as direct questions asking the patient to report

the frequency of adjusting or forgetting medication (scored on a 5-point scale where
5 =never, 4 =rarely, 3 =sometimes, 2 =often and 1 =very often). A total medication
adherence score is obtained by summing responses to each of the four individual items.
Scores ranged from 4 to 20. with higher scores indicating greater reported adherence. The
Cmnbach alpha coefficients for the RAM scale in the main sample range from 0.6-0.83.
0 The Sensitive Soma (SS)Scale. This 5-item scale assesses perceptions of personal sensitivity to the potential adverse effects of medication (e.g. ‘Even small amounts ofmedicines can upset my body’). The scale is currently under development at Rutgers
University New Jersey, USA (Diefenbach et al., 1997) and details of scale items are
available from the authors. Responses are scored on a 5-item Liken scale and the individual item scores are summed to give a total Sensitive Soma score ranging from 5 to 25
where high scores=high perceived sensitivity to the potential adverse effects of medication: This Sensitive Soma scale was administered to the cardiac ( n = 120) and general
medical in-patient (n = 91) samples. The internal reliability of the scale, as measured by
Cmnbach’s alpha, was acceptable in both groups (general-medical=0.80;cardiac =0.78).
0 Single measures assessing medication-related cognitions. The psychometric evaluation
of the BMQ utilised three of the single item statements from the original 34-item pool
described above. The items had not loaded on the BMQ factors and so did not represent
a Specific-Necessity, Specific-Concern, General-Harm or General-Overuse cognition.
However, they seemed, at face value, to represent interesting medication related cognitions and so were used for psychometric evaluation of the BMQ scales.

In addition to these items a further two single item statements were also included as
shown in Table 10. Responses to all five single items were: scored on a 5-point Likert
scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 =strongly agree.
TESTING THE CRITERION-RELATEDAND
DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY OF THE BMQ
Criterion-relatedvalidity

The assessment of the criterion-related validity of each of the BMQ scales was based on
the following predictions:
1. Specific-Necessiry. Patients with stronger beliefs in the necessity of their medication
would be less likely to believe that they can cope without it. Thus scores on the

Downloaded by [Dalhousie University] at 12:27 10 November 2014

BELIEFS ABOUT MEDICINES QUESTIONNAIRE

1s

Specific-Necessity scale would be negatively correlated with scores on the item: ‘I can
cope without my medicines’. Beliefs in the necessity of prescribed medication would
also be related to perceptions of illness. In particular, patients who believed that their
illness would last a long time and who experienced more symptoms would have
stronger beliefs in the necessity of the medication prescribed to treat it. Thus
Specific-Necessity scores would be positively correlated with scores on the Identity
and Timeline components of the IPQ which respectively assess perceptions of symptom severity and likely duration of the illness.
2. Specific-Concern. Patients with stronger concerns about their prescribed medication
would be more distrustful of it, would tend to want more information about it and
would be more likely to want to change their current treatment. Thus it was hypothesised that the SpeciJic-Concern scale scores would be positively correlated with scores
on the ‘Lackof trust in prescribed medication’ and ‘Desire to change present treatment’
items and would be negatively correlated with scores on the ‘Satisfaction with amount
of medicines information received’ item. Additionally, those who perceived themselves
to be susceptible to the potential adverse effects of medication would have stronger
concerns about their prescribed medication. Thus scores on the Specific-Concern scale
would be positively correlated with scores on the Sensitive Soma scale.
3. General-Ham. Patients who believed that medicines in general are intrinsically harmful would be more likely to believe that it is better to avoid taking them. Thus scores
on the General-Ham scale would be positively correlated with scores on the ‘It is better to do without medicines’ and ‘I can cope without my medicines’ items. Moreover,
participants who believed that medicines in general are intrinsically harmful would be
more likely to consider themselves to be susceptible to potential adverse effects of
medication. Thus scores on the General-Harm scale would be positively correlated
with scores on the Sensitive Soma scale which assess perceptions of personal sensitivity to the adverse effects of medication.
4. General-Overuse. Scores on the General-Overuse scale would be positively correlated
with scores on the ‘Ican cope without my medicines’ and the ‘It is better to do without
medicines’ items.
5 . Relations between BMQ scales and reported adherence to medication (RAM). It was
hypothesised that stronger beliefs in the necessity of prescribed medication would be
associated with higher reported adherence. Thus, Specific-Necessify scores would be
positively correlated with the RAM scale scores. Conversely, patients with stronger
concerns about prescribed medication and those who believed that medicines in general
were harmful substances which are overused by doctors would report lower medication adherence rates. Thus correlations between the Specific-Concerns, General-Harm
and General-Overuse and the RAM scale would be negative.
Discriminant Validity

The discriminant validity of the BMQ-Specific scales was tested on the basis of their
ability to distinguish between different illnesses and hence treatment modalities. The discriminant validity of the BMQ-General scales was tested on the basis of their ability to
distinguish between patients presenting a personal prescription at a community pharmacy
and those seeking complementary therapies. The specific hypotheses were as follows:
1. SpeciJic-Necessity.Beliefs about the necessity of prescribed medication would be influenced by the type of treatment typically prescribed for the illness. The characteristic

Downloaded by [Dalhousie University] at 12:27 10 November 2014

16

R. HORNE ETA5

effects of medication on symptoms would be particularly important. For example, diabetic patients who fail to take their treatment may become severely ill very quickly.
Asthma medication often produces symptom relief which the patient can clearly relate
to taking the medication. Similarly, omitting medication may quickly result in adverse
symptoms. Conversely, patients receiving medication for mental health related problems
may perceive a much more tenuous link between their medication and concrete benefit
in terms on symptoms. Thus it was hypothesised that: Specific-Necessity scores would
discriminate between patients from different diagnostic groups. In particular, diabetic
patients would be expected to have higher scores than asthmatic patients who in turn
would have higher mean Specific-Necessifyscores than psychiatric out-patients.
2. Specific-Concerns.Asthma treatment often incorporates corticosteroids. This is a large
group of compounds, some of which are associated with adverse side-effects. Additionally, other members of this drug group are frequently misused in sport and have a
high “media-profile”. Patients’ concerns could be influenced by this. particularly if
they fail to differentiate between steroids they are taking for asthma (which are generally inhaled and therefore less “dangerous”) and the more potent formulations which are
often the subject media attention. Similarly, psychiatric out-patients are often prescribed
‘tranquillisers’,which have also received adverse media attention (Cohen, 1983). Thus
it was hypothesised that Specific-Concernsscores would discriminate between patients
from different diagnostic groups. In particular, asthmatic and psychiatric patients would
have higher mean Specijic-Concernsscores than other illness groups.
3. General-Harm and General-Overuse.People who believe that medicines in general
are intrinsically harmful substances which are overused by doctors may be more
inclined to seek alternative methods of treatment. The hypothesis used to test the discriminant validity of the BMQ-General scales was that people seeking care from a
homeopathic or herbal clinic would have higher mean scores on the General-Harm
and General-Overuse scales than those presenting a prescription for dispensing by a
community pharmacist.

PROCEDURE
The psychometric evaluation was conducted on the basis of interactions between the
BMQ factors and the above measures which had been administered to the main sample at
the same time as the pool of mediation belief items from which the BMQ was derived.
The AllopathidComplementary Care samples were recruited after the BMQ had been
derived fmm the main sample (as detailed in Section I). Only the 8-item BMQ-General
(comprising the General-Overuse and General-Harm scales) was administered to the
Allopathic/Complementary Care samples. The Sensitive Soma Scale was not available
when the asthmatic, diabetic, renal and psychiatric samples were recruited. The scale was
however available when the cardiac and general medical samples were recruited a few
months later. Thus different samples were used to evaluate different psychometric properties. The internal reliability of each scale was evaluated for all 6 illness groups comprising the main sample. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using the asthmatic sample.
Repeat questionnaires were sent to the patients, together with a stamped addressed envelope, two weeks after they had been seen in clinic. Criterion-related validity of the
BMQ-Specific scales was evaluated using the asthmatic sample, except for interaction
between the Specific-Concernsand Sensitive Soma scales which were evaluated using the

BELIEFS ABOUT MEDICINES QUESTIONNAIRE

17

general medical inpatient samples. Relations between BMQ scales and RAM were evaluated on pooled data from the Cardiac and General Medical samples. The discriminant validity of the BMQ-Specific scales was evaluated in the main sample. The discriminant validity
of the BMQ-General scales was evaluated in the Allopathic/Complementary Care sample.

Downloaded by [Dalhousie University] at 12:27 10 November 2014

Stutisrical Techniques

The internal consistency of each BMQ scale was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha.
Spearman correlations (p) were used to evaluate test-retest reliabilities between initial
and repeated test scores for each scale and also the relations between scales used to test
the criterion-related validity of the BMQ. The a priori hypotheses relating to the discriminant validity of the BMQ-Specific scales were investigated using one-way ANOVA and
linear contrasts. Further differences between illness samples were identified using (post
hoc) Tukey's HSD test. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was not used for
analysis of differences in measures due to the moderate level of intercorrelation between
Specific-Concernsand General-Ham (p = 0.31; n =524; p c 0.01) and General-Overuse
(p=O.24; n=524; pc0.01).Differences in mean BMQ-General scores between Allopathic and Complementary care seekers was assessed using an independent samples
t-test. A one-tailed test was used as the direction of association had been specified within
the relevant hypothesis.
RESULTS
Reliability and Scale Interrorrelation

Cronbach alpha values obtained for each of the diagnostic group are shownjn Table 11.
These data indicate that both the BMQ-Specific and the BMQ-General scales have satisfactory internal consistency, with the exception of the General-Harmscale in three of the
diagnostic groups. As both the psychiatric and diabetic samples had received all the items
which subsequently comprised the Specific-Concerns scale Cronbach alpha values could
be calculated for this scale. However, only 3 of the 5 Specific-Necessity items were
included in the original item-pool administered to the diabetic sample and 4 of the 5 were
included in the pool originally administered to the psychiatric sample. Therefore, for the
psychiatric and diabetic samples, Cronbach alpha values were calculated for a 3 and
4-item Specific-Necessity scale respectively. A total of 31 of the asthmatic sample ( n = 78)

Criterion-related Validity
Specific-Necessity. Evidence for the criterion-related validity of the Specific-Necessity
scale was provided by the negative correlation between scale scores and responses to
the statement: “ I can cope without my medicines” (p = -0.44; n = 78; p <0.001) as
expected. As predicted there were also positive correlations with scores on the IPQ
Timeline (p =0.49; n = 77; p <0.001) and Identity (p =0.24; n = 76; p <0.05) scales

Specific-Concerns. Scores for the asthmatic group were positively correlated with the
statement: ‘Icannot always trust my medicines’ (p =0.33; n =78; p < 0.005), and ‘I
would like to change my present treatment’ (p =0.37; n =78; p (0.001). The hypothesis that Specific-Concerns would be associated with a desire for more information
about medicines was confirmed by the significant negative correlation with responses
to the statement: ‘I have been given enough information about my medicines’
(p = -0.45; n =78; p <0.001). As hypothesised, a significant positive correlation was
obtained between Specvc-Concerns and beliefs about personal sensitivity to the
adverse effects of medication as assessed by the Sensitive-Soma scale administered to
the General Medical and Cardiac samples (p = 0.5. n = 2 1 1, p <0.00 1).
General-Ham and General-Overuse. Correlation between General-Harm scores and
responses to the single item statement “It is better to do without medicines” was as
expected (p = 0.23; n = 78; p ~ 0 . 0 5 )Responses
.
to the statement “ I can cope without
my medicines” correlated significantly, in the predicted direction, with both the
General-Ham (p = 0.24; n = 77; p <0.05) and General-Overuse scales (p = 0.34;
n = 78; p <0.005). Correlations between the General-Ham and Sensitive-Soma scales
(p = 0.25, n = 9 1, p <0.05), although small in magnitude, were in the predicted direction and statistically significant.
Adherence to treafment. Correlations between BMQ scales and reported adherence
assessed by the RAM scale to medication were as expected. Specific Necessity beliefs
).
correlated with higher reported adherence (p =0.19; n =210, ~ ~ 0 . 0 1Correlations
between the RAM scale and the Specific-Concerns (p= -0.28; n=210; pc0.001).
General-Overuse(p= -0.19; n=210;p<0.01) and General-Ham (p= -0.06;n=210;
p > 0.05) scales were! all in the predicted direction, although those between the RAM
and General-Harm scales failed to reach statistical significance.

in which mean scores on the BMQ scales were compared across illness samples. It can
be seen that the BMQ scales were able to distinguish between patients on the basis of
illness (and treatment) groupings. The predictions for discriminant validity of the
Specific-Necessity scale were confirmed by the finding that diabetic group had significantly higher Specific-Necessity scores than all other groups and the asthmatic patients
had significantly higher scores than the psychiatric outpatients who attained the lowest
mean as predicted. As was expected, the asthmatic and psychiatric samples had significantly higher Specific-Concernsthan the other illness groups, supporting the discriminant validity of this scale.
2. BMQ-General scales. As was predicted, patients attending a Complementary clinic
(homeopath/ herbalist) had significantly higher scores on both the General-heme
and General-Harm scales than those presenting a personal prescription for dispensing
at a community pharmacy, as shown in Table 14.

DISCUSSION
Exploratory PCA of commonly-held beliefs about medication prescribed for a specific
illness (Specific beliefs) and more general beliefs about medicines as a whole (General
beliefs) produced simple factor structures which were subsequently verified by confirmatory factor analysis. Replication of factor structures in different illness samples showed
an acceptable degree of stability and suggested that the factors represent ‘core themes’
underpinning common representations of Specific and General medication.
The core themes relating to medication prescribed for the patient were: beliefs about
the necessity of the medicines for maintaining health (Specific-Necessity)and concerns
about medication (Specific-Concerns).The Specific-Necessity construct represents the
perceived role of medication in protecting against deterioration of the present and future
health status of the patient. The Specific-Concerns construct comprises aspects of both an
emotional (e.g. “Having to take my medicines wom‘es me”) and a cognitive (“My medicines are a mystery to me”)representation and thus may provide access to both aspects of
the parallel processing described by Leventhal in the SRM (Leventhal et al., 1980)
Both the general factors contain items relating to aspects of medication which are
essentially negative and a coherent “benefit” dimension did not emerge from our original
items. This may be because the items we used were not representative of an underlying
dimension of “benefit”. Alternatively, it may simply be that a clear representation of benefit is obscured by strong beliefs about the potential for harm. It is salient that in most of
the studies from which the item pool was derived, the benefit of medicines was often
taken for granted. People who had generally negative views about medication tended to
cite the potential for ham. rather than the lack of “efficacy” or “benefit” as a focus for
their concerns about medication (Conrad, 1985; Morgan and Watkins: 1988) and other
authors have remarked on this (Fallsberg. 1991). At first sight, the representations of
medicines in general encompassed by the BMQ-General scales seem to amount to a
rather negative view of medicines as harmful and overused by doctors. However, this
does not necessarily mean that most people see medicines in this way. It is possible to
disagree with the statements on each factor and so express a view of medication as essentially safe and appropriately used. The main point here is that PCA showed that certain
medication beliefs (e.g. about addiction, poison, harm, regular long term use) could be
organised into coherent themes relating to the nature of medicines (General-Ham)and
views about how they are used by doctors (General-Overuse).
Measures of internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the BMQ scales were
encouraging as was the criterion-related and discriminant validity data. Expected correlations were obtained between BMQ scale scores and other measures of illness and medication beliefs and between Specific-Concerns and self-reported adherence to medication.
The BMQ scales were able to distinguish between different illness groupdtreatment
modalities. between particular adherence behaviours and between users of allopathic and
complementary therapies.
The internal consistency of the General-Harm sub-scale was disappointing in three data
sets (asthmatic. cardiac and general medical). Examination of Cronbach alpha values following individual item deletions showed that this could not be attributed to a single ‘‘rogue
item” but was a true reflection of low internal consistency. However, in other data sets this
scale had a greater degree of internal consistency. The reason for this disparity is unclear
but seems to support the premise that patients with certain illnesses tend to develop a more
coherent representation of medication in general, which is perhaps influenced by their

personal experience with prescribed medication. We are currently conducting further
studies on the cognitive representation of beliefs about medicines in general using other
samples in an attempt to resolve these issues. In the meantime we recommend that the
General-Harm scale is used with caution.
The scope of the present evaluation is limited by the fact that, due to the lack of availability of validated measures of medication beliefs, aspects of the criterion-related validity of the BMQ scales were evaluated against single-item constructs of attitudes to
specific and general medication. The evaluation of the validity of the BMQ was also limited by the absence of data testing the predictive validity of the measure. This is currently
being evaluated by examining inter-relations between BMQ scales and other variables
separated over a 3-month period. Despite these limitations the data described above provide preliminary evidence for the criterion-related validity, discriminant validity and the
reliability of the BMQ scales and support its use as a research tool within the context of
studies investigating peoples’ beliefs about medication.
The BMQ-Specific is a flexible instrument which can be adapted to assess beliefs about
all medicines for a particular condition or for individual components of the regimen. This
can be achieved by changing the reference statement associated with the questionnaire as
shown in the Appendix. We have also developed versions to assess partner or carer’s
views about a patient’s medication, and parents’ perceptions of medication prescribed for
their child. (Partner and parent versions are available on request from the authors). The
Specific and General questionnaires may be used separately or in combination.
In conclusion, the data presented in this paper confirm the value of the BMQ as a novel
method for assessing beliefs which patients commonly hold about their prescribed medication and about medicines in general. We hope that the measure will facilitate further
research into patients’ perspectives of treatment.
