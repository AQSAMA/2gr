ABSTRACT
Adherence to medication refers to the extent to which an individual corresponds with the
prescribed medication dosing regimen. Medication non-adherence among patients with
schizophrenia is extremely common, broadly ranging from 4% to 72%. This has serious
consequences for individuals as well as the health system, such as relapse of symptoms, rehospitalization, aggression, suicide, cognitive deterioration, loss of job and arrest, victimization,
and overall unfavorable outcome. Factors determining adherence are divided into medicationrelated such as side effects, patient-related such as lack of insight, illness-related such as
persecutory delusions, sociocultural such as stigma, and clinician-related factors such as poor
therapeutic alliance. Adherence is best achieved by exploring the reasons for non-adherence with
appropriate management plans to deal with them. It can be improved by providing basic strategies
that must routinely accompany every prescription and specific interventions, such as psychosocial ones, antipsychotic long-acting injections, reminders, service interventions, and even
financial incentives.

Adherence to Pharmacological Treatment Among Patients with Schizophrenia

INTRODUCTION
Among all mental disorders, schizophrenia is
one of the most serious,1 and it is considered
one of the top 10 causes of long-term
disability in the entire world, affecting about
1% of people.2 Typically, schizophrenia is a
chronic disease, with significant psychosocial and medical consequences. It is
characterized by a constellation of
abnormalities in thinking, emotion, and
behavior.
Patients
diagnosed
with
schizophrenia have a heterogeneous clinical
presentation with no single pathognomonic
symptom.3
The course of the disorder encompasses a
prodromal phase, active phase, and residual
phase.
The active phase includes
hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized
thinking, whereas the prodromal and residual
phases are characterized by attenuated active
symptoms, such as odd beliefs, magical
thinking, and interpersonal and self-care
deficits.4
A characteristic feature of schizophrenia is
the presence of positive and negative
symptoms. Delusions, hallucinations, and
disorganized behavior are considered to be
positive symptoms that reflect distortion of
normal function. The absence of motivation
and interest or blunted affect and alogia are
stated as negative symptoms that largely
account for the long-term morbidity and poor
outcome in functioning in these patients.5
A literature review suggests that the annual
incidence of schizophrenia is about 0.15 per
1,000. The point prevalence is 4.6 per 1,000,
whereas the lifetime prevalence is estimated

32

Iraqi Natl J Med. Jan. 2022; Vol. 4 (1)

to be 4.0 per 1,000, and lifetime morbid risk
is approximately 7.2 per 1,000 persons.6
In males, schizophrenia usually develops in
the mid-20s with an average onset between
20 and 25 years, while in females, it develops
in the late 20s with an average onset between
25 and 30 years.7
The genetic influence in the etiology of
schizophrenia is the most important, with
about 80% of the risk being inherited. Many
environmental factors in early life also
contribute, which interact with the genetic
vulnerability. Together, these risk factors
render the individual prone to the emergence
of symptoms in later life.8
Treatment of schizophrenia initially includes
antipsychotic drugs, some of which relieve
delusions and hallucinations (positive
symptoms) by dopamine receptor blockage,
whereas others may also address the negative
symptoms.9 Thus, antipsychotic agents
enhance recovery through the control of
symptoms, improve quality of life, restore
basic life functioning, and prevent relapse.10
A significant component in treatment is
enhancing the quality of life through
successful jobs and relationships and not just
reducing the signs and symptoms.9
Antipsychotic
medication
alone
is
insufficient to address the complex social,
financial, and health needs of patients with
schizophrenia. Thus, the consensus is the
combination of antipsychotic medication and
psycho-social interventions that range from
psycho-education, assertive community
treatment, supported employment, cognitive
behavioral therapy, family interventions,

Makwan M. Abdul Kareem, Hezha N. Mahmood
family-based services, token economy, skills
training to psycho-social interventions for
substance misuse, and weight reduction.11
Nearly 40% of schizophrenic patients with
treatment continue to experience psychotic
symptoms that can impede their functional
ability, hindering work, relationships, selfcare, and independent living.12
Patients with schizophrenia have lower life
expectancy and poor physical health
secondary to a number of contributing
factors, such as lifestyle risks, adverse effects
of medication, mental stress, loss of
motivation, and healthcare provision. They
may also have a significantly higher
incidence of chronic obstructive airway
disease, diabetes mellitus Type 2, and
ischemic heart disease.13
Medication adherence is the extent to which
an individual's behavior corresponds with the
prescribed medication dosing regimen,
timing, and dosage and medication intake
intervals. Medication non-adherence is a
common issue worldwide with significant
costs particularly in chronic diseases that
need long-term treatment.14
Adherence to treatment involves visiting the
physician regularly, complying with
requirements of the treatment program, and
following the prescription. Partially or
completely not adhering to the prescribed
drugs, taking non-prescribed medication,
discontinuing follow‐ups, or missing
appointments are all indicators of nonadherence to treatment.15
It is estimated that only 50% of patients with
chronic diseases (any physical or mental
condition that lasts for more than a year and

needs continuous care) take their medications
as prescribed. Therefore, improving
adherence to medication is a major priority of
the public health system.16
Alipour et al. (2020) found that patients
having serious mental disorders, including
schizophrenia, may have non-adherence rates
that are equal to or worse than that of patients
with organic diseases, with rates of nonadherence to antipsychotic drugs reaching up
to 89%.17
Medication non-adherence among patients
with schizophrenia remains a dominant
problem, highlighting the need for new
approaches to support patients, such as by
frequent telephone contact, to improve
adherence.18
The estimated rate of non-adherence in
patients with schizophrenia in one study is
50%, broadly ranging from 4% to 72%,19
whereas in another study, the range is from
42% to 74%.20 According to Turkish studies,
69.5% have partial adherence.15
A study in Washington showed that 74% of
outpatients with schizophrenia stop taking
antipsychotics within two years of leaving
hospital.21
In addition, there are some variations in
adherence
rates
in
patients
with
schizophrenia over time; for example, up to
25% of patients are non‐adherent whether
partially or completely 10 days after
discharge from hospital, and this percentage
increases to 50% at one year and to 75% by
two years.22

Medication
non-adherence
among
schizophrenic
patients
has
serious
consequences for individuals as well as the
country, frequently leading to higher rates of
relapse and exacerbation of psychotic
symptoms, frequent hospital admissions,
frequent emergency visits,23 increased
aggressive behaviors, and a worse overall
outcome, compared to adherent patients.24
Relapse of illness may endanger both the
patient and other people. In about two-third
of cases, re-admission to hospital is the result
of non-adherence or partial adherence. After
a year of the first hospital admission, 40% of
relapse results from medication nonadherence.25 Furthermore, it is estimated that
the risk of relapse is 3.7 times higher in nonadherent subjects than in patients with good
treatment adherence.26
Other consequences of non-adherence
include increased cognitive deterioration,26

Etiology of medication non-adherence
Adherence to medication is not a simple
issue, as there are multiple factors that can
influence it. These factors can be divided into
five major groups: medication-related,
patient-related, illness-related, sociocultural,

34

Iraqi Natl J Med. Jan. 2022; Vol. 4 (1)

negative social outcomes such as loss of job
and arrest,27 victimization,28 poor quality of
life, reduction of treatment effectiveness, less
response to subsequent treatment, increased
co-morbid physical illnesses, wastage of
health care resources, and increased risk of
suicide.29 Moreover, the suicide risk in
patients with schizophrenia who are nonadherent is 3.75 times higher than in those
who are adherent.30
In addition, lack of treatment adherence has
significant costs and is associated with a
marked increase in the health services usage.
It is estimated that about 40% of the cost
associated with schizophrenia treatment is
due to non-adherence, involving an annual
expenditure of more than 10 billion dollars
and 400 million pounds in the United States
and the United Kingdom, respectively. 26

and mental-health service-provider-related,31
which can also be titled as clinician-related
factors.22
Medication-related factors involve the drug
being perceived to be ineffective, complex
medication regime, intolerable side effects,
such as weight gain, akathisia,22 and sexually
adverse effects,32 concerns about drug–drug
interaction,33 or higher frequency of
medication.34 It appears that there is an
important positive association between
obesity and distress from weight gain and
medication non-adherence.35
Patient-related factors are lack of insight or
denial of illness, co‐morbid substance misuse
and/or personality disorder, being male and
young, personal beliefs about the illness,

Makwan M. Abdul Kareem, Hezha N. Mahmood
perception of illness severity, concerns about
dependency on the prescribed drugs,
concerns about long‐term side effects, lack of
knowledge of medication, misunderstanding
the instructions, and simply forgetting
medication,22 which is the most common
cause of missing medication dose.36 Other
factors are negative attitudes/beliefs about
medication,37 maladaptive coping skills or
personality traits,38 previous history of nonadherence, and chronic medical diseases.36 In
addition, it is estimated that up to 25% of
patients with schizophrenia when effectively
treated report missing (i.e., craving for or
desire to) their psychotic experiences
(missing the voices, missing the feeling of
power), which thus acts as a motive for nonadherence to medication.22,39 According to a
Pakistani study, 36% of patients mentioned
that "I forgot to take my medication," and
32% of them reported that "I thought that I
am better now, and do not need to take my
medication."40 Lack or impaired insight into
illness is one of the key reasons that are
associated
with
non-adherence
to
antipsychotic medication. It is estimated that
nearly 60% of patients suffer from moderateto-severe impairment of insight. Individuals
with impaired insight are likely to deny or
minimize the need for treatment, have
negative attitudes/beliefs toward medication,
and have more tendencies to stop taking their

drugs. Patients with first-episode psychosis
were studied for a year, and it revealed that
non-adherent persons had a lower level of
insight at baseline at one year compared to
the adherent patients. In another study,
patients with first-episode schizophrenia
treated with antipsychotics and who appeared
to have impaired insight at six months were
associated with 1.4 increased risk of nonadherence to medication.41
Moreover, illness-related factors cover
specific symptoms such as loss of interest,31
persecutory
and/or
grandiose
delusions/thoughts,
severe
psychotic
42
35
symptoms,
suspiciousness,
hostility,
cognitive impairment, and depressive
symptoms.41
Furthermore, sociocultural factors include
beliefs of family about the illness and about
medication, peer pressure, religious beliefs,22
low educational level, low socioeconomic
status,35 insufficient income, transportation,
homelessness,43 living alone,44 lack of
family/social support,45 location of treatment
services,46 racial and ethnic minority,47 and
stigma.31
Lastly, clinician‐related factors include
perceiving the clinician as dismissive or
authoritative, not feeling listened to or
consulted, poor given explanation of
treatment,22 less emotional support from the
physician,31 and poor therapeutic alliance.35

Estimating non-adherence to medication
Many methods of medication adherence
monitoring are available. The most
commonly used method is self-report, but it
is most likely to overestimate adherence.
Urine and serum testing provide adherence
information only for the days immediately
before testing, and it is not available for all
drugs. Pharmacy refill rates can be used too
to monitor adherence but are problematic if
patients change pharmacies or use multiple
pharmacies. Furthermore, pharmacy refill

36

Iraqi Natl J Med. Jan. 2022; Vol. 4 (1)

rates provide no information about drug
ingestion. Similarly, counting pills cannot be
considered a measure of actual ingestion of
medication.48
Management
of
medication
nonadherence
Exploring the attitudes and reasons for poor
drug
adherence
with
appropriate
management strategies planned is one way to
improve adherence to
medication.49
Accumulated research data concluded that

Makwan M. Abdul Kareem, Hezha N. Mahmood
individually
tailored
multi-component
interventions have the best chance to improve
adherence.50
Improving adherence to antipsychotic
medication includes basic strategies that must
routinely accompany every prescription and
specific interventions. Moreover, these
specific interventions can be subdivided into
five headings: psychosocial interventions,
antipsychotic
long-acting
injections,
reminders including electronic methods,
service
interventions,
and
financial
51
incentives.
Basic strategies to accompany prescribing are
crucial to improve adherence, such as
involving patients in decisions and choice of
their drug, listening to them, understanding
their beliefs and concerns about the
medication and their illness, warning them of
potential side effects before starting
medication, increasing dosage gradually, or
explaining that adverse effects should
disappear; these can decrease the risk of side
effects impairing adherence. Potential side
effects can be managed by dose reduction,
starting a specific treatment, changing time of
taking the drug, or changing to another
antipsychotic. For example, a greater dose
can be given at night if the antipsychotic is
causing sedation, it can be swallowed with
water if the drug is resulting in dry mouth, a
weight loss program can be maintained in
case of weight gain, anticholinergic agent can
be used to deal with antipsychotic-induced
Parkinsonism, and another antipsychotic can
be switched to in order to deal with side
effects of prolactin elevation like
galactorrhoea or sexual dysfunction. In

addition, adherence can be improved by
simplifying the prescription regimen in those
with complex ones.51
Psychosocial interventions to enhance
adherence to antipsychotic drugs are psychoeducation,
behavioral
interventions,
motivational interviewing, and cognitive
methods.51
Psycho-education is defined as a process of
teaching patients with mental disorders about
the nature of their illness including etiology,
progression, consequences, treatment, and
prognosis.52 Behavioral interventions cover
skills learning, practice of activities,
behavioral modeling, and reinforcement
methods.51 Motivational interviewing is an
effective intervention to enhance the patient's
motivation for changing behavior and
improving adherence to medication.53
Principles of both motivational interviewing
and cognitive behavioral therapy can be
combined and called adherence therapy,
which is a brief patient-centered approach
and aimed at amplifying benefits of
treatment, modifying beliefs about illness
and treatment, resolving ambivalence toward
taking drugs,54 and discussing stigma.1
Successful cognitive and behavioral
interventions that improve adherence are
those that enhance the therapeutic
relationship.51 It is estimated that
motivational techniques or concrete problem
solving are successful intervention programs
that improve medication adherence among
schizophrenic patients.55
Long-acting injection (LAI) formulations of
antipsychotics were developed to enhance
treatment adherence and may improve

Adherence to Pharmacological Treatment Among Patients with Schizophrenia

having medication pre-packed in packets
labeled with the day and time to be
ingested.51 Other technologies are being
increasingly used to maintain adherence to
medication, such as simple reminders to take
medication via cell phone or SMS
messages.58
Service interventions ensuring that services
are readily accessible to patients are likely to
improve adherence. These include ensuring
ready access to emergency departments,
setting appointments with minimal delay, and
using prepayment cards to reduce total
prescription costs.51
Furthermore, financial reinforcement is
emerging as a potential plan to enhance
adherence to medication in severe mental
illness.59 Financial incentives provision to
improve adherence in patients taking
antipsychotic drugs is a promising
intervention60 but raises ethical issues.51

outcomes in schizophrenia, administration
schedules ranging from fortnightly to every
three months. LAIs with FDA approval for
treatment of schizophrenia are aripiprazole
monohydrate,
fluphenazine
decanoate,
haloperidol decanoate, olanzapine pamoate,
paliperidone palmitate, and risperidone
microspheres.
Current
schizophrenia
treatment guidelines recommend LAI use in
patients who are insufficiently adherent to
medication and for patients who prefer such
treatment.56 Maintenance therapy with LAI
has been shown to reduce risk of relapse and
re-hospitalization.57
Reminders are helpful in unintentional nonadherence when the patient forgets to take
medication. But this method is unlikely to
help when non-adherence is intentional.
Reminders may involve written notes to take
medication that are placed in prominent
places, setting alarms for taking drugs, or
