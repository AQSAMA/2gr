Abstract
Background—Reports suggest increased use of alcohol, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs in
Iraq in the past decade, which may portend an increase in substance use disorders (SUDs) and,
thus, an increased need for treatments.

Author Manuscript

Objectives/Methods—To develop better information on the nature and extent of drug and
alcohol use in Iraq, the Iraqi Ministry of Health, with support from the U.S. government and
technical assistance from U.S. researchers, held an initial Iraqi Community Epidemiology Work
Group meeting in May 2012 in Baghdad. Drug seizure data was the primary data source, provided
by Iraqi law enforcement and customs officials. Ministry of Health officials presented data from
hospitals (medical and psychiatric), outpatient clinics, and health centers, as well as from surveys
of medical patients, pharmacy patients, and prisoners.
Results—The data suggest that the most commonly used substances are alcohol, hashish, and
prescription drugs. New drugs in Iraq's drug use scene include the amphetamine-type substances
“Captagon” and crystal methamphetamine, and the painkiller tramadol. Seizures of Captagon,
methamphetamine, Afghan opium, teriac (a crude form of opium), and heroin at border crossings
may indicate that these substances are becoming more popular. A plan for an ongoing program of
CEWG meetings was developed.

Author Manuscript

Conclusions—Drug and alcohol use in Iraq is increasing and new drugs are appearing in the
country. An ongoing program for monitoring drug use trends and informing Iraqi policy makers is
important for public health planning, including the development of strategies to identify citizens
with SUDs and provide them treatment.

Drug and Alcohol Use in Iraq
The Republic of Iraq, with an estimated population of 34 million people, is a country
bordered by the Islamic Republic of Iran to the east, Turkey to the north, Syria to the
northwest, Jordan to the southwest, and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to the south. As of 2010,
there was no official Iraqi agency or organization conducting country-wide or even regional
data collection on substance use (World Health Organization [WHO], 2010). Thus,
estimates of the patterns and consequences of drug use must be derived from various official
and unofficial sources, none of which fully and accurately depicts the substance use
situation in Iraq. Some observations from the WHO Regional Office report (WHO, 2010) on
Iraq are that:

Author Manuscript

•

increased drug use has occurred among females and youths; the drugs being used
include sedatives, benzhexol (Artane®, an anti-Parkinson drug) and inhalants (e.g.,
paint thinners, glue);

•

adults also use benzodiazepines and benzhexol to deal with stresses caused by
conflict and war; in addition, codeine is popular;

•

opiate use, primarily as smoked opium or heroin, occurs at unknown levels;

•

high (and rising) rates of drug use occur in prisons and in urban areas;

•

data about cannabis use are not available, but cannabis is widely used.

Author Manuscript

A survey conducted in 2009 found that lifetime prevalence of alcohol use in Baghdad was
17.8% and drug use prevalence was 7.02% (Al-Hemiary, Al-Diwan, Hashim, & Abdulghani,
2010). Besides the growing levels of alcohol use, which is occurring along with increasing
alcohol availability, especially in Baghdad, commonly used drugs across the country are
sedative hypnotics and benzhexol. In an article on Iraqi psychiatrists' perceptions of the drug
situation in the country (Al-Hasnawi, Aqrawi, Sadik, & Humphreys, 2009), the authors
reported on a survey of psychiatrists (70) working in Iraq. Fifty-eight of the 70 psychiatrists
(83%) completed the survey regarding patients seen in private or government clinics for
substance use disorders. Responses indicated that diverted medications, which were mostly
obtained through the black market and privately owned pharmacies (without a prescription),
were the leading drug problem, particularly benzehexol and anxiolytic medications,
including benzodiazepines. These increases in the use of alcohol, prescription drugs, and
illicit drugs may indicate an increase in substance use disorders in the country and,
therefore, an increased need for treatment interventions.

Need for More Current and Comprehensive Information on Alcohol and
Author Manuscript

Drug Use in Iraq
In order to develop a coordinated response to the problems related to the use and abuse of
substances in Iraq, the Iraqi Ministry of Health, with funding from the U.S. Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and technical assistance from U.S.
researchers, developed a plan for building an ongoing process for obtaining timely and
accurate information for Iraqi policy makers on the nature and extent of drug and alcohol

use in Iraq. The method chosen for collecting and organizing this information is the
Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG).

The Community Epidemiology Workgroup Surveillance System

Author Manuscript

The CEWG is a surveillance system that provides information on changes in illicit drug use,
drug supplies, and drug-using populations, as well as the consequences of drug use on users.
Data gathered and shared during the CEWG meetings can highlight an emerging problem or
show how an existing problem is changing. The CEWG methodology was established in the
United States in 1976. Comprising a network of researchers from major metropolitan areas,
the U.S. CEWG has been used to provide ongoing community-level surveillance on the
nature of emerging trends in substance use in the United States, and this information has
been used to directly inform policy makers. Data is gathered from multiple sources,
including law enforcement records, hospital emergency department admissions, drug
treatment centers, medical examiners' and coroners' offices, public health centers, surveys,
and ethnographic research. The objectives of the CEWG are to identify local drug use
patterns, monitor drug use trends, and detect emerging substances of abuse. Once this
information has been obtained, representatives of the Iraq CEWG will communicate and
disseminate the information to appropriate agencies to assist in the development and
assessment of policy decisions, prevention strategies, and treatment intervention strategies
(National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2006).

Iraq Community Epidemiology Work Group

Author Manuscript

The initial meeting of the Iraq Community Epidemiological Work Group (Iraq CEWG)
occurred May 8 and 9, 2012, at the Ishtar Sheraton in Baghdad, Iraq (Al-Hemiary, AlDiwan, Hasson, & Rawson, 2012). The meeting brought together leaders from the substance
use disorders sector, public health sector, and mental health sector; law enforcement
representatives; university teachers and researchers; governorate representatives; NGOs;
representatives from the Ministries of Health, Interior, Labor & Social Affairs, Youth &
Sports, and Justice; and international technical assistance experts. The 2-day meeting
reviewed the importance of and methods for developing a capacity in Iraq for better
understanding the nature and extent of drug and alcohol use in the country and reviewed
some of the existing data on this topic.

Author Manuscript

During the morning of the first day of the meeting, Iraqi and international speakers provided
background and a rationale for using the CEWG methodology as an epidemiological data
approach. During the afternoon of the first day and the morning of the second day, a series
of 14 reports were given that presented data and information on the current use of drugs and
alcohol in Iraq. The primary data source was drug seizure data provided by law enforcement
and customs officials from locations around Iraq. In addition, Ministry of Health officials
presented data from hospitals (medical and psychiatric), outpatient clinics, and community
health centers, as well as from several surveys of medical patients, a survey of pharmacy
patients, and three prison surveys. On the afternoon of the second day, a workshop was
conducted to discuss ways of improving future CEWG meetings by expanding the types and
sources of data that would help meet the CEWG goals.

Alcohol/Drug Use Information Presented at the Iraq-CEWG
In previous reports about drug use in Iraq (Aqrawi & Humphreys, 2009), prescription
medications were the drugs most widely misused, with benzhexol, benzodiazepines, and
codeine being the drugs most commonly reported. The primary source of these drugs was
pharmacies in Iraq, many of which provided these medications without the necessary
prescriptions. Reports in the Iraq-CEWG suggested that seizures of prescription medications
occur throughout Iraq, suggesting that availability is still widespread. In contrast, seizures of
illegal drugs are made predominantly in the southern governorates and in Kurdistan, in the
north. It appears that Basra (Iraq's major port city) is one of the main entry points for much
of the illicit drug supply in the south, and the border of Iran is an entry point in the north.

Author Manuscript

Reports from law enforcement officials regarding drug seizures indicate that two types of
amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) have made a recent appearance in Iraq: “01 Pills”
(Captagon tablets, an amphetamine-type drug, likely containing methamphetamine) and
“crystal” (methamphetamine). The seizure reports estimate an expansion of the
amphetamine market in Iraq. The first seizure of Captagon tablets (and powder) was made in
2009. Since that time, Captagon seizures have increased substantially. The Captagon is
coming into the country via ships traveling to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia, whereas the
“crystal” has been seized at border crossings with Iran. With a long and increasingly open

border with Iran, it is likely that methamphetamine manufactured in Iran is being transported
into Iraq.

Author Manuscript

Until 2009, hashish dominated non-pharmaceutical drug seizures, with only small quantities
of heroin and opium being confiscated. While the absolute amounts of hashish seized by law
enforcement has continued to increase, in 2010 and again in 2011, heroin/opium accounted
for 15% and 5% of the total seizures, respectively. When evaluated on their own, these
numbers may not be startling; however, this trend represents a significant shift from
previous years, when hashish accounted for nearly 100% of the national drug seizures
(Rawson, 2011). Traditionally, opium is used in the form of “teriac” in Afghanistan, Iran,
and some Asian countries. Teriac is a crude form of opiuim sold in digit-sized chunks that is
either eaten or smoked in a variety of ways, including using a “shisha” (waterpipe). In 2010
and 2011, there were multiple reports of seizures of teriac close to the border with Iran
(Rawson, 2012). At the present time, there is evidence of heroin use in Iraq, which is
primarily smoked or snorted. Injection does not appear to be the preferred route of
administration by the majority of users.

Author Manuscript

Significantly increased use of tramadol (a relatively weak mu-opiate agonist) was reported
in a number of the regions in Iraq. In Mosul, a city in the north of Iraq, a study was
conducted on 122 individuals who were using tramadol. Of those interviewed, 15.6% used
tramadol by injection. Regarding people's reasons for using Tramadol, 45.8% reported using
for chronic pain, 23.8% for acute pain, and 30.2% for psychological well-being. Of those
interviewed, 30.2% reported having a prior addiction to drugs or alcohol, and 18% reported
that they had tried to stop using tramadol but had been unsuccessful; 14.7% reported that
they sometimes take tramadol to get high, and 46.7% have purchased tramadol from a drug
dealer. Tramadol use was reported as the primary substance use disorder of patients
admitted for treatment at the Baghdad Medical City Detoxification Unit.

Plans for Future Iraq-CEWG Meetings
Following the data presentations and discussions, the group recognized the following
considerations for future meetings:
Geographic representation

Author Manuscript

Discussion about the most important geographic regions to be represented in future Iraq
CEWG meetings centered on cities/regions with high rates of tourism/visitors, including
border cities and religious centers. The following cities were identified as the 10 cities with
the highest priority: Basrah, Anbar, Najaf, Wasit (Kut), Karbala, Sulaymaniyah, Baghdad,
Erbil, Mosul, Muthanna (Samawah).
Types of information to access
At the present time, there is one inpatient treatment center in Baghdad and psychiatric units
in Mosul and Basra. The only data available at present concern the type of substance used on
admission. For subsequent CEWG meetings in Iraq, attempts will be made to obtain and
present the following data:

Author Manuscript

Surveys are among the primary sources of data on drug use. Surveys conducted regularly on
populations at risk can provide information on attitudes, as well as trends and emerging
problems. One specific suggestion was that a national survey on alcohol and drug use be
conducted in Iraq to inform future CEWG meetings. A suggested parameter for the survey is
to sample approximately 3,000–4000 participants nationally. The survey will be done by
local staff who will receive a one-week training course in survey data collection, including
training on survey research ethics and confidentiality. Sampling will collect information
from a representative segment in each governorate; in addition, the following populations at
high risk will be oversampled: sex workers, street vendors, and young adults. Saliva samples
will be collected on a subset of participants and tested to assess validity of the self-reports.

Summary

Author Manuscript

The initial meeting of the Iraq Community Epidemiological Work Group brought together
leaders from a broad swath of Iraqi institutions. The 2-day meeting reviewed the importance
of and methods for developing a capacity in Iraq to better understand the nature and extent
of drug and alcohol use in the country and reviewed some of the existing data on this topic.
The findings from this meeting suggest that since the time of the reports by Aqrawi and
Humphreys (2009) and Al-Diwan (2010) on drug use in Iraq, as summarized in Rawson
(2011), some aspects of the drug-use situation in Iraq have remained relatively stable, while
there have been significant changes in other areas. The psychoactive substances most widely
used in Iraq continue to be alcohol and the following prescription drugs: benzodiazepines,
benzhexol, codeine, and a variety of psychiatric medications. This set of “primary drugs” is

consistent with the earlier reports. However, there was near universal agreement that the use
of hashish, tramadol (an opioid-type analgesic), and amphetamine-type substances (ATS) is
increasing rapidly in some areas and that drug and alcohol use overall is increasing. Reports
from Basrah health officials and police were noteworthy. Two types of ATS have been
seized in considerable amounts in Basrah: “01 Pills” (tablets of Captagon, an amphetaminetype drug) and “crystal” (methamphetamine). The 01 Pills appear to be of the same type of
ATS that are being used in epidemic amounts in Saudi Arabia, and they appear to be coming
into the country via ships traveling to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia. The crystal is likely
coming from Iran, since drug seizures have been near the Iranian border and crystal use in
Iran is very extensive. In addition, reports from Mosul and from federal drug seizure data
suggest that the use of tramadol is also increasing substantially in many parts of Iraq. This
drug is available to users from pharmacies and from street drug dealers. At the present time,
there is little evidence of increased use of heroin in Iraq, and rates of injection drug use
appear to continue to be relatively low.
The practical advantage of CEWG methodology is its use of existing data, prepared in a
standard format. The data from existing sources is augmented by research and population
surveys, when available. A national survey is currently being planned to provide new
information, which will inform future meetings of the Iraqi CEWG and, it is hoped, lead to
improved treatment for Iraqis with substance use disorders.
