j Abstract Background Although studies have
shown that views about causation are strongly associated with stigmatising attitudes to mental illness,
none have examined the correlates of such causal
views in order to identify the population needed to be

pattern and correlates of lay beliefs regarding the
causes of mental illness in south-western Nigeria.
Method A cross-sectional survey in which respondents (n = 2,078) were administered questionnaire
detailing sociodemographic variables and perceived
causation of mental illness. Results Beliefs in supernatural factors and the misuse of psychoactive substances were the most prevalent. While urban
dwelling, higher educational status and familiarity
with mental illness correlated with belief in biological
and psychosicial causation, older age, rural dwelling,
and lack of familiarity correlated with a belief in
supernatural causation. Educational status had no
effect on the belief in supernatural causation. Conclusion Anti-stigma programmes need to incorporate
these factors in order to identify the population at
risk, who will actually benefit from targeted education
regarding the causes of mental illness.

Introduction
There has been an increased interest in the perceived
causation of mental illness by the public in recent
times. Studies from the western culture showed that
biological factors (diseases of the brain and hereditary
influences) and environmental factors (trauma and
stress) were more frequently considered to be of
causal relevance [4, 10, 22] while in Africa, beliefs in
supernatural causation is widely held [3, 11, 20].
However, in Nigeria, the available literature is not
conclusive on the beliefs of the community about the
causes of mental illness. While mystical causes were
most frequently reported in central Nigeria [3], misuse
of drugs was the most widely held belief regarding causation of mental illness in northern Nigeria [15]. A recent
study among the Yoruba communities in south-western
Nigeria [11] found that the most commonly reported
causes of mental illness were drug and alcohol misuse
(80.8%), possession by evil spirits (30.2%), traumatic
event or shock (29.9%), stress (29.2%), and genetic
inheritance (26.5%). In this large study, only about one
in ten respondents believed that biological factors or
brain disease could be the cause of mental illness.
Most studies have concluded that views about
causation are strongly associated with stigmatizing
attitudes to mental illness [12–14]. So it is a widely
shared opinion that an increase in literacy and education regarding the cause of mental illness will result
in an improvement in attitude toward people with
mental illness [22]. Analyses of the recent trends in
researches however have faulted the assumption that
there is a positive relationship between endorsing
biological causes and acceptance of people with
mental illness [4, 8].
Available studies in sub-Saharan Africa have suggested a preference for traditional and spiritual
healers for the treatment of mental illness [3, 15]. It is
known that the bulk (approximately 70%) of mental
health services provision in Nigeria is delivered

337

through non-orthodox means such as religious organizations and traditional healers [7]. Traditional
healers could recognize symptoms of mental illness,
and they also expressed strong beliefs in supernatural
factors as a cause of mental illness [2]. Since patients
suffering from mental illness and their carers are
likely to share the beliefs regarding the causes of
mental illness held by the society where they live,
knowledge of the preference of the lay public
regarding causes of mental illness will be helpful in
evaluating the patient’s help seeking behavior.
None of the available studies have examined the
correlates of such causal views and identify the population at risk, who will actually benefit from targeted
education regarding the causes of mental illness.
The present study aimed at evaluating the lay beliefs
regarding the causes of mental illness in south-western
Nigeria and examining the factors correlating with such
beliefs. The hypotheses of the present study include the
following: (1) that the Yoruba communities in Nigeria
will have pre-scientific beliefs regarding the causes of
mental illness (2) beliefs in supernatural causation will
be more common among the rural dwellers and uneducated persons in the community.

psychosocial factors (substance and alcohol misuse, life stresses,
personal deficit, or failure/lack of willpower), supernatural factors
(witchcraft/sorcery/evil spirits, God’s will/divine punishment, and
destiny/bad luck), and biological factors (heredity, brain injury, and
contact with mentally ill/childbirth). The nine items were drawn from
a list of 23 possible causes of mental illness earlier suggested by the
patients, the relatives, community opinion leaders, traditional healers, spiritual healers, and the lay public. A panel of six consisting of a
psychiatrist and a representative each from the list above harmonized
the suggested causal factors into the nine items grouped into three.
Although the questionnaire seemed to have face validity, the psychometric properties were not formally examined before use. Using a
four-point likert scale (‘‘not a cause’’, ‘‘rarely a cause’’, ‘‘likely a
cause’’, and ‘‘definitely a cause’’), the respondents were asked to
indicate how relevant they considered each potential cause to be.
Responses of ‘‘likely a cause’’ and ‘‘definitely a cause’’ are counted as
endorsing a cause. The questionnaire was translated into the local
Yoruba language by back-translation method involving two independent panels consisting of a psychiatrist and a Yoruba linguist
each. Precise idiomatic equivalents were employed as much as possible. In the translation, care was taken to convey a broad meaning of
mental illness to differentiate it from psychosis.
j Procedure
Written informed consents were obtained from the participants
after the aims and objectives of the study had been explained. The
Ethics and Research Committee of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex approved the study protocol.
Research assistants who are medical students in psychiatry postings
administered the questionnaire to the participants.

Method
j Data analysis
j Participants and sampling technique
The participants were from three selected communities in Nigeria
(an urban, a semi-urban and a rural community). The communities
were selected in conformation with the classification according to
the 1991 population census in Nigeria [13]. A multistage probability sampling technique was then used to select participants.
The first stage consisted of random selection of seven enumeration areas from each of the three communities. The enumeration areas
are geographical units demarcated by the National Population
Commission [18] with each area consisting of about 100–120
household units. The second stage involved enumeration of the
houses in each area. When more than one household was found in a
house, one household was selected by balloting. The third stage involved the selection of one adult (above 18 years) from each household for the interview. From this a total of 2,342 participants were
targeted for the interview and these include 854 from urban settlement, 782 from semi-urban settlement, and 715 from rural settlement.
j Instruments
Pro-forma
The participants were administered a semi-structured questionnaire inquiring about sociodemographic data such as age, sex,
marital status, religion, ethnicity, highest education obtained, and
occupation. The questionnaire also inquired whether the participants have ever had a personal encounter with the mentally ill or
ever cared for the mentally ill and whether he/she has a family
member/friend who has or has had mental illness.
Causal attribution
Respondents’ attributions of the possible causal factors of mental
illness were assessed by responses to a nine-item questionnaire
detailing possible causes of mental illness. The causes included

The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS) version 11. For ease of analysis, most of the variables were grouped. Results were calculated as frequencies (%),
means, median, and mode. Group’s comparisons were by the chisquare test. Significance was calculated at P < 0.05. Logistic
regression was used to calculate the variables independently associated with the perceived causal factors. Odds ratio (OR) and 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated where appropriate.

Results
j Sociodemographic details
Out of 2,342 scheduled for interview, only 2,078 were
successfully administered the questionnaire. The
reasons for failure to administer the questionnaire to
the rest 264 (11.2%) of the participants scheduled for
interview included not meeting the participants at
home after repeated visits and refusal to give informed consents. There were no statistically significant differences in the age, sex, and educational
attainment of the respondents and those who could
not be interviewed.
The 2,078 included 658 (31.7%) from the rural
community (response rate 92.0%), 712 (34.3%) from
the semi-urban community (response rate 91.1%),
and 708 (34.0%) from the urban community (response rate 82.9%). Analysis (Table 1) showed 1,278
(61.5%) were 50 years old or less, 1,133 (54.5%) were
males, and 1,289 (62.0%) were married. There were

1,130 (54.4%) Christians and majority (89.9%) were
from the Yoruba ethnic group. Majority (74.3%) had a
primary or secondary education. Only 228 (11.0%) of
the participants had had an encounter with someone
with mental illness while 102 (4.9%) had ever cared
for a mentally ill and 612 (29.5%) had a family
member or friend with mental illness.

j Pattern of perceived causation of mental illness
Table 2 showed that the most frequently endorsed
causation was misuse of substances and alcohol
(72.3%) followed by witchcraft/sorcery/evil spirit
(65.5%) and God’s will/divine punishment (50.1%)
while personal deficit/failure was the least endorsed
(10.2%). Since most of the participants endorsed multiple items cutting across the causal groups, to know the

number of endorsed item in each group was calculated
with the result indicating supernatural causes having
the highest score with an average of 1.80 (median = 1
and mode = 1) followed by psychosocial causes
(mean = 1.52, median = 1, and mode = 1) and biological causes (mean = 1.14, median = 1, and
mode = 1). Based on this, endorsement on each causal
group was dichotomized as endorsement of more than
one more item in a group or not. According to this
categorization, 912 (43.9%) participants endorsed
more than one item on ‘‘psychosocial causation’’ while
more than one item on supernatural and biological
causations were endorsed by 1,016 (48.9%) and 632
(30.4%) participants, respectively.

j Correlates of perceived causation of mental illness
Chi-square analysis was used to calculate the univariate association between the sociodemographic
variables and multiple endorsement of each of the
causal groups and the result (Table 3) showed that
endorsing more than one item on psychosocial
causal factors was significantly associated with
urbanicity, highest education, ever cared for the
mentally ill and having a family/friend with mental
illness. Endorsing more than one item on supernatural causal factors was significantly associated
with age, ethnicity, urbanicity and having an
encounter with the mentally ill while endorsing
more than one item on biological causal factors was
significantly associated with ethnicity, occupational
status, highest education, caring for the mentally ill,
and having a family/friend with mental illness.
The significant variables were then entered into
logistic regression analysis to determine the variables
independently associated with multiple endorsements
on each of the causal groups. The remaining variables
for psychosocial causal factors were urbanicity
(B = 0.621, Wald = 28.237, P < 0.001), care for
mentally ill (B = 0.973, Wald = 17.489, P < 0.011),
and educational level (B = 0.312, Wald = 9.987,
P = 0.002). For supernatural causal factors, encounter
with mentally ill (B = )2.237, Wald = 116.204,
P < 0.001), age group (B = 0.972, Wald = 93.042,

Discussion
To our knowledge, our study was the first attempt to
examine the patter and correlates of lay beliefs
regarding causes of mental illness in sub-Saharan
Africa. Previous studies have correlated beliefs with
stigma, but have not evaluated the pattern and correlates of the beliefs in order to identify the target
groups for intervention.

j Pattern of beliefs regarding mental illness
We found a widespread belief regarding supernatural
factors and the misuse of psychoactive substances and
alcohol as the main cause of mental illness in this
study and this is in agreement with previous researches in this area [3, 11, 15, 20]. Compared to the
prevalent belief in biological factors in Germany [5]
and constitutional and environmental factors in
Canada [22], our findings suggest that there may be
cross-cultural variations in the pathway between
causal belief and help seeking. Since the views about
causation are strongly associated with stigmatizing
attitudes to mental illness, these beliefs might be
major contributors to the increasing stigmatizing
attitude in Africa [12]. A belief that mental illness is
due to misuse of drugs or alcohol may translate to the
notion that mental illnesses are self-inflicted and this
may elicit condemnation rather than understanding
or empathy [23]. Also, the belief in supernatural
causation of mental illness might make close association with the mentally ill unattractive and perceived
to be risky. This may also imply that ‘‘western’’
medical care would be futile and may inform preference for traditional and spiritual healers for treatment. Likewise, studies have also shown that the
traditional healers themselves considered that actions
of the enemies, usually employing meta-physical
means, are a major cause of mental illness [17].

j Correlates of perceived causation of mental illness

j Limitations and strength

Our study showed that our participants believed in
multiple factors as causes of mental illness. While
previous studies on causal beliefs have controlled
these beliefs for influences of socio-demographic
variables, we have grouped causal beliefs into three
groups and examined for socio-demographic correlates of these groups. This methodological difference
was necessary because many of our respondents hold
multiple and diverging beliefs regarding the causes of
mental illness.
We found urbanicity, educational status, occupational status, age, and familiarity with mental illness
as the important independent correlates of multiple
perceived causation of mental illness. While urban
dwellers were more likely to endorse multiple psychosocial factors than rural dwellers (50.0% vs.
38.4%), the rural dwellers were likely to endorse
multiple supernatural factors (54.4% vs. 44.6%). This
finding should not be surprising since compared to
the more traditionally oriented rural dwellers, people
living in urban cities were more likely to be more
‘‘western’’ in their approach to life.
Related to this was the finding of multiple
endorsements of psychosocial and biological causal
factors in those with higher education. But a critical
analysis showed that educational level had no effect
on the endorsement of supernatural causal factors.
This suggests that although higher education may
have made our participants endorse more psychosocial and biological causal factors, it had no effect
on the belief in supernatural causes which was
widely held irrespective of the educational level.
This queries the assumption that western education
changes the beliefs in supernatural causes of mental
illness.
Our study found that older people (>50 years)
were more likely to have multiple endorsements of
supernatural factors as causes of mental illness (OR
2.59, 95% CI 2.15–3.12). Older people are more likely
to hold traditional and pre-scientific views about the
causes of mental illness which may not be easily
amenable to changes. Not surprisingly, older age had
been correlated with poor attitude toward mental illness in studies in western [9, 10, 22] and non-western
cultures [15, 19].
From our study, while more familiarity with
mental illness (having a family member or ever care
for the mentally ill) was associated with multiple
endorsements of biological and psychosocial causal
factors, lack of a personal encounter with the
mentally ill was associated with multiple endorsement of supernatural causation. Previously, it is
known that having personal experience or contact
with the mentally ill reduce stigmatizing attitude [1,
16, 21], now our study have suggested that it might
also affect the perception of the causes of mental
illness.

There were a number of limitations to this study.
First, one should be careful about generalizing the
results of this study to other ethnic group in Nigeria
or sub-Saharan Africa. There are several cultural
differences in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa and this
may affect their beliefs regarding causation of mental
illness. Information is required for each cultural
group and a larger, multi-centered cross-ethnic study
will be desirable in the future. Also, caution must be
taken in inferring causality as this was a cross-sectional study and the related factors were just correlates. This study also focused on mental illness in
general whereas it is known that the public have different views and attitudes toward different specific
mental disorders [6]. The strength of the study was in
its large sample size, in its being community based
and coming from a culture not well studied.

Conclusion
The results of this survey suggest that the public in
south-western Nigeria hold multiple views regarding
the causes of mental illness. It also further confirms that
supernatural factors and the misuse of psychoactive
substances and alcohol were perceived as the main
causes of mental illness in sub-Saharan Africa. While
urban dwelling, higher educational status, and more
familiarity with mental illness correlated with belief in
biological and psychosocial causes of mental illness,
older age, rural dwelling, and lack of familiarity with
mental illness correlated with a belief in supernatural
causation. Educational status did not have an effect on
the belief in supernatural causation. The current antistigma programme by the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) needs to incorporate the factors associated
with views about causation in the anti-stigma educational programme so as to identify the population at
risk, who will actually benefit from targeted education
regarding the causes of mental illness.
