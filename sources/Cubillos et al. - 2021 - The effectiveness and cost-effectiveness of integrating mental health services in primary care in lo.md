Aims and method This systematic review examines the eﬀectiveness and
cost-eﬀectiveness of behavioural health integration into primary healthcare in the
management of depression and unhealthy alcohol use in low- and middle-income
countries. Following PRISMA guidelines, this review included research that studied
patients aged ≥18 years with unhealthy alcohol use and/or depression of any clinical
severity. An exploration of the models of integration was used to characterise a
typology of behavioural health integration speciﬁc for low- and middle-income
countries.
Results Fifty-eight articles met inclusion criteria. Studies evidenced increased
eﬀectiveness of integrated care over treatment as usual for both conditions. The
economic evaluations found increased direct health costs but cost-eﬀective
estimates. The included studies used six distinct behavioural health integration
models.
Clinical implications Behavioural health integration may yield improved health
outcomes, although it may require additional resources. The proposed typology can
assist decision-makers to advance the implementation of integrated models.
Keywords Mental health integration; depression; alcohol use; primary care;
provision of services.

Burden of depression and unhealthy alcohol use
Depression and unhealthy alcohol use are worldwide public
health problems. Depression is the single most signiﬁcant
contributor to global disability, accounting for 7.5% of all
years lived with disability.1 Unhealthy alcohol use accounts
for 5.9% of all global deaths and 5.1% of the entire global
burden of disease,2 and >80% of this occurs in low- and
middle-income countries. Individuals suﬀering from depression and unhealthy alcohol use are at increased risk for
poorer health outcomes from other illnesses, such as tuberculosis, maternal and infant conditions and HIV/AIDS.3,4 In
low- and middle-income countries, societal impacts related
to depression and unhealthy alcohol use can exceed

healthcare costs.5,6 The aﬀected populations have higher
rates of unemployment, reduced job functioning and lower
educational attainment.7
Despite the existence of cost-eﬀective interventions for
these conditions, up to 90% of individuals living with mental
illnesses in low- and middle-income countries lack access to
care.8,9 Moreover, in low- and low-middle-income countries,
only 1% of the population with substance use disorders has
access to minimally adequate treatment.10 Factors like low
levels of public expenditures, reliance on out-of-pocket payments, preferential funding of hospital-based models of care
and signiﬁcant workforce shortages reduce the availability
and accessibility of mental healthcare.11–13

Typology of behavioural health integration in
high-income countries
Behavioural health integration into primary care is thought to
be an eﬀective way to reduce the treatment gap in resourceconstrained settings.14 Nonetheless, the vast majority of studies assessing the eﬀectiveness of this integration originate in
high-income countries. A meta-analysis, including mostly
studies from high-income countries, found moderate-quality
evidence that brief interventions in primary healthcare can
reduce alcohol consumption in unhealthy drinkers compared
with minimal or no intervention.15 Similarly, research studies
from high-income countries revealed signiﬁcantly better outcomes for adults with depression treated with collaborative
care management compared with care as usual.16,17
In high-income countries, diﬀerent integration models
have been classiﬁed based on the nature and level of coordination between highly specialised providers. Several highincome countries have developed their own classiﬁcation
adapted to their health system, and these typologies are
commonly used in research and healthcare management.
For example, the United States Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration conceptualised a
typology based on the degree of collaboration between primary care and behavioural healthcare specialists.18 At the
most basic level, specialists refer patients to another location
(coordinated care). At the intermediate level, providers
deliver care at the same site but do not share treatment
plans (colocated care). At the highest level of integration,
specialists are part of the same team with a unique treatment plan, and the patient experiences a single system (integrated care). Collaborative care management, the most
commonly studied integration models in high-income countries,19 is most often located in this highest level of integration. However, we are unaware of the existence of a typology
built speciﬁcally for low- and middle-income countries.

Behavioural health integration in low- and
middle-income countries
In low- and middle-income countries, researchers have studied task-shifting, often referred as task-sharing, which is the
use of non-specialist primary health workers (such as general practitioners or nurses) and lay health workers to
deliver mental health interventions and increase the availability of mental healthcare services.20–22 A review of evidence found that interventions delivered by lay health
workers may increase the number of adults recovering
from depression, reduce symptoms for mothers with perinatal depression and decrease the quantity of alcohol consumed by unhealthy drinkers.23 In another review,
Seidman and Atun24 found task-shifting to hold potential
for cost-saving and eﬃciency improvements in health systems in the care of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Evidence
for mental health conditions is unclear.24 Both reviews
found minimal relevant economic studies.
This systematic review aims to summarise the evidence
of eﬀectiveness and economic evaluation of the behavioural
health integration of the management of depression and
unhealthy alcohol use into primary healthcare in low- and
middle-income countries. For the purpose of this review,

all types of economic evaluations (such as costminimisation,
cost–utility,
cost–beneﬁt
and
costeﬀectiveness analysis) were included.25 We included all
types and levels of severity of depression and unhealthy
alcohol use. Additionally, we propose a typology to characterise the models of behavioural health integration in lowand middle-income countries, using the evidence of the
experimental studies included in the review. This typology
could assist hospital and district managers, programme planners and policy makers in their decisions to improve the
availability of mental healthcare services.
This systematic review is part of the formative phase of
Project Detection and Integrated Care for Depression and
Alcohol Use in Primary Care (DIADA), an implementation
research project in Colombia, Peru and Chile, funded by the
National Institute of Mental Health. Project DIADA studies
technology-enhanced service delivery models for treating
comorbid depression and unhealthy alcohol use in primary
healthcare in multiple sites in urban and rural Colombia.26

Method
Protocol and registration
We designed this systematic review according to Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
guidelines.27 We registered this review in the PROSPERO
International Registry of Systematic Reviews (identiﬁer
CRD42017057340).

Phase 1: search strategy
This systematic review had ﬁve phases. In the ﬁrst phase,
medical librarians developed the search strategy, translating
research concepts into controlled subject headings and natural language terms. The search included articles from 1990
to 2017. We chose to start the search at 1990 because before
this date few, if any, studies in low- and middle-income
countries were utilising behavioural health integration models. The following databases were searched for relevant
abstracts: Medline – PubMed (search date 28 April 2017),
Web of Science (search date 28 April 2017), PsycINFO
(search date 28 April 2017), EMBASE (search date 4 May
2017), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(search date 28 April 2017) and the World Health
Organization’s (WHO) Global Index Medicus (search date
28 April 2017). The search also included relevant conference
proceedings, grey literature and review references in related
articles (Table 1). Abstracts in English, French, Spanish and
Portuguese were included based on co-authors’ proﬁciency
in these languages. The search found 8786 abstracts after
removing duplicates. Search keywords included, but were
not limited to, ‘depression’, ‘alcohol use disorder’, ‘integrated
care’ and ‘developing country’. A full list of search terms for
all databases searched, including PubMed (Medline), can be
found under Supplementary File 1 available at https://doi.

evaluations of the implementation of a behavioural health
integration model on the management of depression and
unhealthy alcohol use in primary healthcare in low- and
middle-income countries. Articles eligible for inclusion
were required to meet the following criteria: (a) studies
included patients aged ≥18 years, of any gender and with a
diagnosis of alcohol use disorder and/or depression of any
severity; (b) studies performed with a population living in
low- and middle-income countries as per the World Bank
country income classiﬁcation28 during the year that the
study started; (c) studies included patients who received
mental health services (in depression and/or alcohol use
disorder) in fully or partially integrated primary health
services in low- and middle-income countries29 and (d) studies included the integration of pharmacological or
psychological interventions, or a combination of both. All
study designs were considered. We excluded single-case
studies, presentations, abstracts, notes, corrections and
studies that did not report eﬀectiveness or economic evaluation outcomes.

suﬃcient statistical data to be included in a subsequent
meta-analysis (Fig. 1).

Phase 4: data extraction
In phase 4, we completed an in-depth data extraction with a
previously designed form (Table 2). We also completed a
standardised assessment of bias of all the included randomised controlled trials, using methods described in the
Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias.30
This assessment of bias included a team of two of the
authors independently evaluating the studies across seven
categories: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective
reporting and other bias. Studies were rated across these categories as having a ‘low risk of bias’, ‘unclear risk of bias’ or
‘high risk of bias’, and all discrepancies on risk classiﬁcations
were resolved by a third author.

Phases 2 and 3: abstract and full-text review

Phase 5: patterns in the organisation of care of
behavioural health integration models

Using previously agreed inclusion criteria, three teams of
two researchers per team each independently screened a
third of the abstracts and titles (approximately 2918
abstracts). Disputed references (around 11%) were sent
to an arbiter who settled the discrepancies. A total of
147 articles (roughly 1.7% of original abstracts) were
selected for full-text appraisal of inclusion criteria. In
each team in phase 3, one reviewer acted as the primary
reviewer, the second reviewer evaluated the work for discrepancies and an arbiter settled the diﬀerences. This fulltext review identiﬁed 58 articles meeting inclusion criteria, 40 of which met study design criteria and provided

During phase 4, we noticed patterns in the reorganisation of
care that enabled the delivery of integrated mental health
interventions in the treatment arms. We used the 2018
Joint Commission Ambulatory Accreditation Quality of Care
Standards to assess the dimensions of quality of care involved
in these reorganisations of care.31 We updated the data extraction form used in phase 4, adding variables related to organisation of care, and reviewed all articles once again (Table 2).
We extracted data by structural coding. During phases 4 and
5, one researcher (L.C.) extracted these data, with a second
reviewer (S.B.) assessing the data for discrepancies. An arbiter
resolved any diﬀerences that the researchers found.

Results
Description of the included studies
The 58 included publications corresponded to 53 unique
studies assessing the eﬀectiveness or performing an economic evaluation of behavioural health integration in 19
low- and middle-income countries. Of the 58 articles, 20
took place in a rural setting, 3 took place in semi-urban settings, 23 took place in urban settings, 7 took place in both
rural and urban settings, and the settings of the remaining
5 are unclear or unable to be categorised. The vast majority
of the studies introduced interventions in primary healthcare, although some interventions were introduced in communities, over the phone or in public hospitals. Of the 55
articles for which this categorisation applies, 22 articles
studied only women, 3 studied only men and 30 studied
both women and men. Eleven articles came from lowincome countries, 19 articles came from lower-middle
income countries and 28 articles came from upper-middle
income countries. Based on the WHO regional grouping
classiﬁcation,32 22 articles came from Africa, 15 articles
came from the Americas, 13 articles came from Southeast
Asia, 8 articles came from the Eastern Mediterranean

region and 2 articles came from the Western Paciﬁc region.
Two studies counted for both India and Pakistan, which are
classiﬁed in two diﬀerent WHO regions (Supplementary
Table 1).
We found that of the 58 total articles, 46 focused on
depression, 9 focused on unhealthy alcohol use and 3
focused on both illnesses. Further, 49 assessed the eﬀectiveness of integration models, 6 performed economic evaluations, 2 performed both assessments and 1 presented a
descriptive analysis. Of the 51 publications reporting eﬀectiveness data (8 reported economic evaluation data), 40
focused on depression, 9 focused on alcohol use and 2 presented data related to both conditions. These 51 publications
also varied in study design: 36 studies were randomised controlled trials, 7 were quasi-experimental studies and 8 were
observational studies.
We found a high risk of selection bias among our studies, owing to a lack of blinding of ‘participants and personnel’; more than 75% of our studies had a ‘high risk’ of this
type of bias. This ﬁnding was not surpirising given the
nature of the mental health interventions, for many of
which it was not possible to blind the study participants.
The eﬀect on the evidence quality is low since the authors

behaviours.33–35 Two other publications lacking positive
ﬁndings selected primary outcomes highly susceptible to
confounding.36,37 In India, Pradeep et al38 sought to improve
treatment-seeking behaviours and adherence to antidepressant medications by enhancing usual care. In Iran,
Malakouti et al39 sought to reduce the number of suicides.
In Pakistan, Husain et al40 compared the eﬀectiveness of
psychotherapy to antidepressant medications in reducing
depression and improving quality of life. This group compared two integrated interventions without contrasting it
to usual care and found no diﬀerence between these two
arms.

How is supervision done?

Alcohol use

Who refers the patient?

Eleven articles reported eﬀectiveness data related to
unhealthy alcohol use.41–51 All 11 used a reduction in alcohol
consumption as their primary outcome. Ten of these articles
were randomised controlled trials (Supplementary Table 1).
Of these, ﬁve favoured the intervention arm,41,42,45,48,50 ﬁve
did not show diﬀerences between arms or after the intervention43,44,46,49,51 and one had unclear results.47 For the studies that favoured the intervention arm, only one paper
reported eﬀect size (d = 0.95).52 For most studies, secondary
follow-ups showed that statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences
sustained over 3 months to 12 months post-intervention.
The two most commonly delivered interventions were
screening followed by brief intervention or by motivational
interviewing. In Thailand, Noknoy et al,41 and in South
Africa, Rendall-Mkose et al,48 found that motivational interviewing arms produced better outcomes than enhanced
usual care in improving patient outcomes. In Kenya,
L’Engle et al45 found that screening and a brief intervention
can reduce self-reported alcohol consumption among female
sex workers at risk for HIV. In South Africa, Mertens et al44
found that patients receiving brief intervention had signiﬁcantly reduced Alcohol, Smoking and Substance
Involvement Screening Test scores. However, in South
Africa, Peltzer et al,46 and in Thailand, Assanangkornchai
et al,51 found no diﬀerence between brief intervention and
simple advice as both arms similarly reduced alcohol consumption. Similarly, in South Africa, Sorsdahl and
Petersen,49 in an uncontrolled before-and-after study, did
not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant decrease in alcohol use in pregnant
women following a brief intervention.
In Kenya, Papas et al50 found eﬀectiveness of cognitive–
behavioural therapy over treatment as usual in reducing use
and attaining abstinence in patients living with HIV. In
India, Nadkarni et al42 developed a novel and culturally
adapted psychotherapy for unhealthy alcohol use delivered
by lay health workers, called counselling for alcohol problems.
Patients receiving counselling for alcohol problems showed
higher remission rates and higher proportion of alcohol-free
days than individuals receiving enhanced usual care.

used standardised and objective methods for outcome measurement (Fig. 2).

Results of the eﬀectiveness studies
Depression
Forty-two articles presented eﬀectiveness data on depression care (Supplementary Table 1). The most frequently
studied primary outcome was severity of depression. The
treatment arm usually received a psychological intervention
like cognitive–behavioural therapy, problem-solving therapy,
psychoeducation or interpersonal therapy, whereas the care
for the control arm was enhanced with screening only.
Thirty-six articles reported that the integration groups had
a greater reduction in depression severity than the control
groups. Of these 36 articles, 5 articles reported eﬀect size.
Overall, diﬀerences between arms sustained through secondary follow-ups ranged from 3 months to 36 months postintervention. Three of the articles that found no diﬀerence
between the control and treatment groups oﬀered only a

healthcare workers expecting to change their clinical

one publication evaluated both conditions.58 Four of these
studies used a healthcare perspective in their economic analysis,52,56–58 two used a societal perspective54,55 and two
used both perspectives.42,53 In economic analysis, a healthcare perspective includes all costs and beneﬁts directly
aﬀecting patients, providers and payers.25 Conversely, a societal perspective takes a broader approach to include healthcare plus other private and public beneﬁts and costs related
to a given condition. Concerning the type of economic analysis, ﬁve studies performed a cost-eﬀectiveness analysis,52,55–58 two completed a cost–utility analysis42,53 and
one study performed both types of economic analysis.54
Three studies used modelling techniques52,57,58 and ﬁve
studies used experimental data from eﬀectiveness
trials.42,53–56
Two of the articles using modelling techniques52,58 utilised the sectoral approach to cost-eﬀectiveness analysis
developed by the WHO’s ‘Choosing Interventions that are
Cost-Eﬀective’ initiative.59 These studies found that a combined intervention of medications and therapy plus

Table 3

proactive case management yielded the highest eﬀectiveness
among the alternative options. In a study in Nigeria, Gureje
et al58 found that a combination of tricyclic antidepressants,
psychotherapy and proactive case management had the highest cost-eﬀectiveness ratio, closely followed by tricyclic antidepressants only (approximately 0.5% less cost-eﬀective). In
Mexico, Del Carmen et al52 found that a medication-only
intervention was the most cost-eﬀective, followed by a combination of medication, psychotherapy and proactive case
management (approximately 10.5% less cost-eﬀective).
From a healthcare perspective, the economic analyses of
the experimental studies showed that the intervention arms
had increased eﬀectiveness and costs.42,53,54,56 The increased
direct costs were associated with increased utilisation of
healthcare personnel and medications. These interventions
were deemed cost-eﬀective based on the acceptability threshold and commonly accepted values for cost-eﬀectiveness.
Using a Markov model, in Chile, Siskind et al57 modeled the
cost-eﬀectiveness of a stepped-up care intervention throughout the lifetimes of a cohort of Chilean adult females. This

study also evidenced increased direct healthcare costs, but
found integration to be very cost-eﬀective.
Notably, from a societal perspective, these interventions
were found to reduce costs, usually associated with
decreased time costs to patients and families, as well as
fewer productivity losses.

Models of behavioural health integration
The control arm of the experimental studies included in this
review used treatment as usual (minimal or no services) or
enhanced usual care. In contrast, to integrate mental healthcare, the treatment arms redesigned their care by selecting
at least one of the seven strategic intervention options
(Table 3). Each strategic intervention option represents a
discrete active enhancement to the primary healthcare
aﬀecting workforce capacity, information management or
daily ﬂow of care.31 The behavioural health integration

models tested in the research are made up of one or more
strategic intervention options. Furthermore, the treatment
arms of the 53 studies included in this secondary analysis
clustered around 6 of these integration models (Table 4).

model.52,57,58
Models 1–3 rely on building the capacity of nonspecialist health workers in primary care, and they represent
diﬀerent task-sharing models. These models heavily depend
on organisational strategic intervention options 1–4. Unlike
models 4–6, the ﬁrst three models do not depend on
increased coordination between primary health workers, or
between the primary healthcare site and other healthcare
organisations. There are also minimal modiﬁcations in the
daily ﬂow of care. Starting in model 4, these integration

models increasingly require collaboration and information
ﬂows across multidisciplinary teams. Patient-level data is
strategically used to improve the care of patients in models
5 and 6.

Model 1: general training on mental healthcare for lay health
workers and primary health workers
Seven studies met the criteria for model 1. This model utilises strategic intervention option 1. In this model, following
training only, lay or primary healthcare workers (general
physicians and nurses) are expected to have an increased
ability to diagnose and treat mental health conditions
adequately. For example, a study in Colombia61 compared
the diagnostic accuracy and eﬀectiveness of general physicians who had received formal training on mental healthcare
to that of similar general physicians who did not. The study
found that patients in the intervention arm received better
treatment, had increased rates of retention and had lower
depression scores than the control arm.

Model 2: mental healthcare interventions delivered by lay health
workers
Twenty studies met the criteria for model 2. In addition to
general training (strategic intervention option 1), lay health
workers also receive speciﬁc training, ranging from a few
days to 2 weeks (strategic intervention option 2), that prepares them to deliver targeted interventions, such as screening, problem-solving or interpersonal therapy. This model
requires that the primary healthcare site either hires new
lay health workers (strategic intervention option 3) or reassigns those currently delivering other services (strategic
intervention option 4). This model may beneﬁt from having
primary health workers (general physicians or nurses) perform supervisory functions. Using this model, a study in
rural South Africa62 compared the eﬀectiveness of a
12-week course of interpersonal therapy delivered by lay
health workers to enhanced care in the reduction of depression among low-income women. Patients in the intervention
arm showed a signiﬁcant decrease in depression symptoms
upon completion of the 12-week course.

Model 3: mental healthcare interventions delivered by primary
health workers
Eleven studies met the criteria for model 3. This model uses
strategic intervention options 1 and 2 plus either strategic
intervention option 3 or 4. This model often uses ﬂow of
care modiﬁcations to carve out dedicated time for the primary
health workers. A study in rural Thailand41 compared the
eﬀectiveness of nurse-delivered brief interventions versus
treatment as usual (e.g. no brief intervention) in the reduction
of alcohol consumption among low-income males. Patients in
the intervention arm reported a more substantial decrease in
drinks per drinking day and frequency of unhealthy drinking
assessed 6 months after the intervention.

Model 4: consultant liaison
One study met the criteria for model 4. This model oﬀers the
primary health worker access to onsite or telemedicine consultation services from a mental health worker such as psychologists or psychiatrists (strategic intervention option 5),
although the primary health worker continues to be the

main provider. Consultation services include education,
problem-solving and feedback to the primary health worker
regarding diagnostic or treatment strategies.63,64 Strategic
intervention option 5 is essential in this model. A study in
Chile36 compared the eﬀectiveness of treatment delivered by
general physicians with access to online psychiatric consultation services with that of those without access to this support
in the management of urban women diagnosed with depression. Patients in the intervention arm had a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in their depression scores compared with those
in the control arm at 3 months of the intervention.

Model 5: stepped care
Eight studies met the criteria for model 5. This model provides
a structured way to match treatment intensity with the
patient’s needs.65 More complicated patients are cared for by
a mental health worker (strategic intervention option 5),
whereas more straightforward cases remain under the care
of the primary health worker (strategic intervention option
4). Some studies used lay health workers, creating a three-level
stepped care model (strategic intervention option 3). This
model distinctively uses a set of clinical criteria and a pathway
of care to systematically step up or step down each case. Thus,
this model adds outcome tracking to inform the level of care
provided to a patient (strategic intervention option 6). A postrollout evaluation in Iran39 assessed the eﬀectiveness of a suicide prevention strategy for adults with depression. In this
programme, a lay health worker reached out to patients to
screen them for depression and referred positive cases to a primary health worker for management and stabilisation. In turn,
the primary health worker referred refractory cases to psychiatrists who delivered specialised services.

Model 6: collaborative care management
Six studies met the criteria for model 6. There is variation in
the literature regarding the components of collaborative care
management, and there are diﬀerent levels of complexity
within collaborative care management itself.66 For this systematic review, strategic intervention options 6 and 7 are
considered critical. Other collaborative care management
elements, such as linkage to community resources, patient
self-management support, regular case consultation from a
psychiatrist, provider decision support and healthcare
organisation support, could also be present.
In China, a study67 compared the eﬀectiveness of two
modalities of depression treatment for adults aged ≥60
years. In the intervention arm, general physicians (strategic
intervention option 4), primary care nurses serving as care
managers (strategic intervention option 7), and psychiatrists
(strategic intervention options 5) comprised the treatment
team. General physicians received written guidelines for
the treatment of depression, as well as in-depth training in
the prescription of antidepressants and the appropriate use
of referrals to the psychiatrist (strategic intervention options
1–3). Nurses acting as care managers provided psychoeducation to patients and families, assistance with communication
between patients and providers, and support for the
patient’s adherence to treatment. A study psychiatrist was
made available in case of referrals. General physicians in
the control arm only received written guidelines for depression treatment, patients’ PHQ-9 scores and major

depression diagnoses from the screening stage. Patients in
the intervention arm experienced signiﬁcantly greater
reductions in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores
than those in the control arm.

Discussion
Overview
The ﬁndings of this systematic review support the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent models of integrating depression and
unhealthy alcohol use care in primary healthcare in lowand middle-income countries. Patients receiving treatment
in the integrated models tend to have better outcomes compared with those receiving regular care. The evidence appears
more robust for depression than for unhealthy alcohol use.
The economic analyses indicate that integrated models have
higher direct costs to primary health, and that from the
healthcare perspective, these models are cost-eﬀective. It is
also possible that behavioural health integration saves costs
to society by increasing productivity and decreasing time
losses, among other beneﬁts. The typology proposed in this
article can improve the understanding of the diﬀerent models
of behavioural health integration in low- and middle-income
countries. This information can be valuable for policy makers
and hospital managers responsible for the organisation and
delivery of care. Additional implementation studies are
required to further characterise the diﬀerent models of integration and to understand better the conditions needed for
the implementation of each of them.

Increased eﬀectiveness across diﬀerent settings and
populations
The studies included in this review showed that integrated
models can improve patient outcomes in diﬀerent subtypes
of depression such as perinatal depression, late-in-life
depression, comorbid depression and HIV, and depression
associated with trauma disorders in war-aﬀected areas.68,69
Previous research shows that some psychological treatments
can be as eﬀective as antidepressant medications, with
higher retention rates and better continuing outcomes.70,71
We found that diﬀerent psychotherapies can be eﬀectively
delivered by an array of integration models. These can be
more culturally adaptable,72 and possibly less stigmatising
than medication-based treatments. They can also be potentially scalable in low- and middle-income countries contexts
where community bonding is strong, labour is more available and procurement and distribution chains for pharmaceuticals are precarious.
This systematic review suggests that integration of care
for unhealthy alcohol use might produce better outcomes for
the general population, pregnant women and people living
with HIV in low- and middle-income countries. The control
arm of seven included trials compared screening and minimal psychoeducation to screening and brief intervention
or motivational interviewing oﬀered in the intervention
arms.41–44,46,48,51 The enhancement of the control arms
could account for the non-positive results, particularly in
settings where neither screening nor minimal psychoeducation is routinely oﬀered in primary healthcare. There is

48
https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.35 Published online by Cambridge University Press

evidence that screening alone can aﬀect the patients’ behaviours, which could explain the lack of diﬀerence between
arms in some studies.73 Kaner et al15 found that screening
and brief interventions can reduce alcohol consumption in
hazardous and harmful drinkers compared with minimal
or no interventions in primary healthcare in high-income
countries. Although the ﬁndings of the articles included in
this review are similar to those in high-income countries,
we found few studies targeting unhealthy alcohol use that
fulﬁlled our selection criteria, which may aﬀect the generalisability of our ﬁndings. More research in the adequate care
of unhealthy alcohol use in low- and middle-income countries is needed.

Increased funding is a necessary, but not suﬃcient
condition to increase access to care
The economic evaluations included in this review indicate
that integrated models may result in increased direct costs
to primary health, stemming from increased utilisation of personnel and medications. Nevertheless, they may save costs to
society.42,53,57 These ﬁndings are similar to those found in
high-income countries.74 Given the low levels of spending
on mental healthcare in many low- and middle-income countries,11 where the vast majority of primary healthcare sites do
not provide access to mental health services, the ﬁnding that
increasing the availability of mental health services increases
direct costs should not surprise. Since low- and
middle-income countries favour funding of mental health hospitals,11 new resources should be earmarked to sustain behavioural health integration in primary care. Moreover, the way
in which the health system pays or transfers funds to primary
healthcare should also be carefully examined. Health economics literature has extensively shown that these payment
mechanisms are key determinants of providers’ behaviours.75
The most commonly used payment mechanisms in many lowand middle-income countries are out-of-pocket, capitation
and historically determined allocations;76 however, since
they are not explicitly linked to outputs or outcomes, they
do not provide adequate incentives to increase the availability
of integrated services. Recent research in high-income countries has studied the development of new payment mechanisms to promote increased integration and coordination of
care for populations with multiple chronic comorbidities.77,78
Additional research is needed to speciﬁcally adapt payment
mechanisms to oﬀset the increased direct costs related to
behavioural health integration, thus encouraging primary
care in low- and middle-income countries to increase the
availability of services.75 Importantly, public and private providers may respond diﬀerently to these incentives, as evidenced in several studies included in this review where
integration models aﬀected patient outcomes in public, but
not in private organisations.79,80

Typology of integration for low- and middle-income
countries: a tool for decision makers
The reviewed studies tested a variety of models of integrated
care for depression and unhealthy alcohol use. We oﬀer a typology of the models in Table 4 and show how they are built
from one or more of seven organisational strategic

SPECIAL ARTICLE
Cubillos et al Behavioural health integration in LMICs

intervention options. The typology aims to assist decision
makers in selecting the models that are likely to work over
time in their setting. The strategic intervention options, and
the models that ﬂow from them, are not hierarchical but do
vary in terms of cost, complexity and how much organisational
capacity they require to implement and sustain. Decision
makers can choose models that match the characteristics
and capacity of their health system and primary healthcare.
An appealing complex model may not be the right choice if
it is too expensive or requires too much change from the workforce to be implemented or sustained.81 An integration model
that ﬁts well with current programmes and available resources
might have a greater eﬀect over time. Since complex strategic
intervention options require more resources to implement and
sustain, they are more likely to be chosen in higher income
nations. Decision makers must consider eﬀectiveness, acceptability, sustainability and scalability in choosing a model to
meet their system’s needs.

Limitations
This review has several limitations. Some of the studies
included in this review were not rigorously designed trials
and did not have adequate comparison conditions. For
example, some of the studies were post-rollout evaluations
and other were pragmatic or quasi-experimental trials.
This review focused on the care of depression and alcohol
use disorder. Therefore, our ﬁndings may not be generalisable to other mental or substance use disorders. Similarly,
we excluded studies assessing the eﬀectiveness of psychological interventions for these two conditions in low- and
middle-income countries when they did not reﬂect the integration of these treatments into existing primary healthcare
settings. Nonetheless, this systematic review oﬀers important insights into the value and implementation of integrated
models in global mental healthcare.

Implications for the global mental health policy ﬁeld
The ﬁndings of this review build on a wealth of knowledge
strongly supporting the value of integrating mental healthcare
into primary care.77,78 The next generation of research should
aim to understand the arrangements at the system and organisational levels necessary to scale up integrated models in lowand middle-income countries and to promote the delivery of
quality healthcare. In particular, we need to strengthen the
instruments used to measure the quality of integration in
low- and middle-income countries. Similarly, understanding
the reasons underpinning the rampant mental health workforce shortage is critical because behavioural health integration heavily relies on existing and newly available workforce.
To a certain degree, a combination of additional funds and
targeted payment mechanisms can provide the right incentives to overcome some of these implementation challenges
and to sustain quality of mental healthcare. Further research
related to payment mechanisms in primary care in low- and
middle-income countries is therefore critically needed.
The global mental health ﬁeld can learn from other successful global health movements. Eﬀorts to address HIV,
reduce child mortality and improve maternal health were
able to permeate political spaces and become global health

priorities, channelling substantive resources, some of which
have been used to integrate these services into primary care.
At the national level, the experiences of Chile and Zimbabwe
where research studies inﬂuenced the governments to expand
publicly funded mental healthcare programmes can illustrate
processes that occupied the political agenda and aﬀected public policy.82,83 Furthering our understanding of the operation
of behavioural health integration into primary care and bettering our ability to scale up these integrated models can
help close the treatment gap and raise the quality of mental
care in low- and middle-income settings.

Summary Although we commonly work with patients with emotionally unstable
personality disorder (EUPD) in community mental health teams (CMHTs), only
some enter evidence-based psychological therapies. Many patients are not
considered ready to engage in specialist treatments and remain in CMHTs without
any clear focus or structure to their treatment, which is unsatisfactory for patients,
clinicians and services. We present a ﬁctional case and synthesise available literature
and lived experience to explore readiness and ways to promote it. We highlight
relevant issues for trainees to consider in practice. Patients with EUPD who have not
received specialist treatment can be considered in terms of the transtheoretical
model’s stages of change. Identifying a patient’s stage can help guide how to increase
readiness for referral and decide when to refer. Interventions available to all
healthcare professionals which may promote readiness include: psychoeducation,
personal formulations, crisis planning, goal-setting, peer support, distress tolerance
skills, motivational interviewing and mindfulness.
Keywords Borderline personality disorder; community mental health teams;
personality disorders; psychosocial interventions; education and training.
