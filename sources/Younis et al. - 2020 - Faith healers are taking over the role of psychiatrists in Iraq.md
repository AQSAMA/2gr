Background: Due to lack of education and awareness,
faith healing has become a popular way of treating
psychiatric patients.
Objective: To ascertain the role of faith healers in the
treatment of psychiatric illnesses by exploring the
percentage of patients attending those healers.
Methods: A semi-structured questionnaire was
applied through a direct face-to-face interview
with the patients and their companions; it inquired
whether the patient has ever visited faith healers, the
method of treatment the patients were subjected
to, and their opinion about the benefit they got
regarding improvement in their condition.
Results: Among the total 482 cases; 279 (57%)
reported going to faith healers (FHs) at any time
before, during, or after a psychiatric consultation.
Of those, 84.6% reported visiting FHs less than 10
times, while 15.4% went 10 times or more; 36.9%
still believe that the treatment of FHs is accepted or
even good (21.5%), while 30.9% realized that it is
useless, and 10.7% think it is bad. No association was
found between going to FHs and patient age or
gender, while there was a significant association with
marital status (p , 0.02) and with education
(p , 0.001). Patients with schizophrenia/psychosis
or bipolar disorders visited FHs significantly more
often than those with other diagnoses.
Conclusion: Faith healing is prevalent in Iraq and FHs
may overwhelm the role of psychiatrists in treating
mental illnesses. Sincere efforts are needed to help
build public awareness and to improve accessibility
and utilization of mental health services for this
vulnerable group.

Faith healers are taking over the role of psychiatrists in Iraq

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of psychiatric disorders is increasing all
over the world. Global figures show that there are
400 million cases of depression, 60 million bipolar
affective disorders and 21 million schizophrenia/
psychoses.1
For thousands of years, in almost all ancient
civilizations, insanity (losing sound mind) was never
separated from beliefs in adversity from supernatural
agents like evil spirits, demons and devils, or witchcraft
and envying eyes as causative factors.2 In many
cultures, especially in less developed areas of the
world, most of these mental disorders continue to be
viewed as non-medical diseases that are believed to
be caused by invisible entities, spirit possession, or
supernatural powers3 that require supernatural
intervention. A remarkable number of people with such
beliefs adopt additional ways of treating psychiatric
patients such as going to religious centers and visiting
faith healers (FHs).4,5 Faith healing has become a
popular way of treating psychiatric patients due to lack
of education and awareness about mental illness.6
In ancient Iraq (Mesopotamia), many cuneiform clay
texts illustrated symptoms of mental disorders,
attributing them to punishment by Gods and
Goddesses for misdeeds or being possessed by evil
spirits; thus, priests treated patients inside temples
using exorcism (extracting the possessing spirit),
usually using herbal remedies to alter the state of
consciousness, and reading prayers. Healing the
mentally ill was a folk problem with priority given
to shamans and priests during paganism and after
the descent of heavenly religions in Iraq and the
Middle East.7
The ancient belief that fairy demons and sorcery were
the solo explanation of insanity was replaced by
Muslims' beliefs in jinn possession. After the inception
of Islam 646 A.C., the Arabic vocabulary of insanity
(Jinoon) quoted from the Holy Quran was used to
refer to the possession of supernatural spirits known
as "jinn."8,9
Seeking help from traditional or FHs negatively
interferes with providing efficient mental healthcare
to patients, causing a delay in accessing psychiatric
consultation for treatment of serious mental
disorders. It may lead to homicide or suicide, medical
complications, social problems, and/or financial
exploitation in addition to physical, verbal, and sexual
abuse of the patients.10

The role of cultural factors in the management of
mental disorders needs adequate attention from
mental health professionals. It is important to consider
cultural and traditional methods for conceptualizing
and managing mental illnesses as beliefs about mental
illness can affect the willingness of the patients to
seek and adhere to treatment. Understanding cultural
beliefs about mental illness is fundamental for
effective implementation of mental healthcare
approaches.11,12
Iraq has been exposed to a long period of continual
wars, armed conflict, terrorism, and sectarian
fundamentalism, which paved the way for many
behavioral and mental disorders and precipitated
illiteracy that encouraged such practices.
This study was designed to ascertain the role of FHs in
the treatment of psychiatric illnesses through
exploring the percentage of patients attending those
healers to seek help, and to study some relevant
factors. This may help build public awareness about
this issue in order to end this malpractice in the future.

METHODS
This cross-sectional study was conducted during the
period from August 2018 through January 2019 in
the Psychiatric Consultation Clinic in Medical City
Hospital, the main teaching hospital in Baghdad.
A consecutive sample was collected throughout the
study period by pooling all psychiatric cases flowing
into the consultation clinic (and the referred cases
from other hospitals and clinics) on an almost daily
basis (excluding holidays) during the six month period
of the study. The diagnosis of mental diseases was
done on a symptomatic basis depending on the
DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders) criteria. Only children were excluded
because of the differences in the symptomatic
diagnostic modules.
FHs were defined as people held in high regard who
are considered to be spiritual or moral guides; they are
available and accessible in rural and urban areas all
over Iraq, and they are self-authorized to practice
healing of patients without any license or
governmental supervision.

Study instruments
A semi-structured questionnaire form was developed
by the researchers; the main question was whether
the patient had ever visited FHs, religious persons or

Faith healers are taking over the role of psychiatrists in Iraq

any traditional healer to seek curative help for his/her
illness. The questionnaire also inquired about the
method of treatment the patients were subjected to,
how much they paid for it, their opinion about the
benefit they got regarding improvement in their
condition and whether they would or would not
advise others to experience this practice. The
questionnaire was translated into Arabic and then
retranslated to English to enhance validity.
Two well-trained senior psychiatrists (a male and a
female) were recruited for data collection; they were
supervised by the leading researcher who is a
Professor and Consultant in Psychiatry with extensive
experience in the field.
Data collection was done through a direct face-toface 15 –20 minute interview with the patients
(and their companions). The questions were direct,
and the answers given by the patients were
confirmed by the companions for more precision.
As Iraq is not a cosmopolitan country and Islam is
the state religion, this was taken into consideration
when probing for details concerning the traditional
healing methods.

Ethical issue
The purpose of the study was explained to the
patients and their companions giving them the
complete unconditional choice whether or not to
participate. A verbal consent was taken from the
patients (or their companions) after assuring them
that the information they gave would be kept strictly
confidential, would not be accessible to anyone but
the researchers and would not be used for any
purpose other than research work.
Statistical analysis was done using the available
statistical package of SPSS (Statistical Packages for
Social Sciences-version 24). Data was presented as
central tendency measures of frequencies and
percentages. Significance of association was tested
using Pearson Chi-square and Fissure-Exact test.
Statistical significance was considered with a p-value
equal to or less than 0.05.

RESULTS
The total collected sample was 482 cases with a
response rate of 100%.
Table 1 shows the demographic distribution of the
sample: 71.2% aged between 20–49 years with a
female predominance (58.7%); 57% of the patients

reported going to FHs at any time before, during, or

Table 2 reveals that 73.1% of those who went to FHs
did so before visiting the psychiatric clinic, and 23%
were still going to FHs while receiving their medical
treatment. 84.6% reported visiting FHs less than ten
times, while 15.4% went 10 times or more. In respect
to the method of treatment, in 55.2% of the cases, a
mascot (amulet) was used, while the Quran (the holy
book of Muslims) was mentioned by 49.8%. Some of
the patients (3.6%) were subjected to different forms
of sexual harassment as a "method of treatment."

to FHs; of those, 11.6% paid more than $1000.

DISCUSSION
FHs in Iraq represent an undeniable source of care for
mentally ill patients despite the availability of qualified
mental health professionals in Baghdad (the capital)
and almost all governorates.10,13 This finding is
reinforced by the marked increase in the number of
FHs to the degree of becoming highhanded masterful
therapists. Interestingly, some famous healers are
practicing their job frankly under the eyes of the state
without any control. In our study, we tried to explore
the size and magnitude of this phenomenon as a
community and how health problems continue to
flourish despite continuous efforts since 2003 to
build a sustained mental health system.13,14
Depression topped the list of psychiatric diagnoses, in
line with the results of some international studies.1
This finding is not surprising as depression is usually
precipitated by repeated exposure to violence and
psychological trauma in addition to persistent
daily-life difficulties which is the case in post-conflict
Iraq. This results in anxiety disorders as well; the third
common diagnosis; it is common for anxiety and
depression to co-exist, especially in times of war and
conflict.14,15 Psychotic disorders (presented mainly
by schizophrenia) were the second most common
diagnosis, which is consistent with previous studies.16
A sizable ratio of the cases were co-morbidity;
a well-defined psychiatric disorder overlapping with a
less defined one or with somatic and dissociative
symptoms.
The results revealed that more than half of the
patients (57.9%) reported going to FHs; this is
comparable to some studies conducted in other Arab
and Muslim countries17,18 but is obviously higher than
what was found in those studies.19 This high
percentage is alarming as it indicates that FHs have
started to overwhelm the role of psychiatrists in
treating mental illnesses, which takes us back to
ancient times when FHs and witchcraft therapists had
the upper hand in this field. There might even be a
slight underestimation here as some patients may feel
ashamed to reveal that they are visiting FHs so as not
to be judged.
The vast majority of FHs were males (this might be
because females in Iraq are still wary of taking on such
jobs), most of whom were of religious nature, perhaps
to be more convincing and appearing pious in order to
make patients feel more at ease.

Many people think that visiting FHs is not as
stigmatizing as going to psychiatric clinics and
receiving medications, which is a likely reason for
increasing numbers of patients who choose traditional
healers as their first treatment choice prior to seeing a
psychiatrist.13 Choosing FHs as the first station of
treatment was considered by more than 70% of the
patients in the current study; this is higher than what
Alosaimi found in Saudi Arabia.17
Visits to FHs between one and nine times was
reported in 84.6% cases, while 15.4% reported
10 visits or more, which reflects the strength and
preservation of their beliefs in FHs, and may also give
an indication of these patients' financial capacity.19

From a clinical point of view however, by seeking
medical help, this indicated that the patients were
gaining no or very limited benefit from FHs.
Most of the patients (89.9%) reported going to a
Shiite cleric (Sayed) or Sunni cleric (Sheikh), both of
whom were believed to be either a descendant of holy
dynasty or a blessed religious guide who have the
capability to practice mystic therapy.
FHs in this study utilized methods to protect from or
to exorcise evil eyes, the devil, and jinn possession.
The most common methods used were reading
certain verses of the Holy Quran; they also performed
oral and written prayers in the form of sealed amulets,
incantations read-in-water for drinking and/or

bathing, steaming by blessed incense, and re-wearing
the patient’s own gown after storing it in the FH’s
place for one night. However, many other traditional
remedies not linked to Islamic beliefs were also used,
such as ingestion of uncharted herbs as powder, liquid,
alone or mixed with honey, or as a paste to massage
onto the body. These methods are commonly used in
Arab communities.7,17,18,20
About one quarter of the patients were treated with
harmful methods for exorcism like frequent jabbing by
the healer’s baton, harsh thrusting or cruel beating all
over the body, beating with a stick or slapping or
hitting the patient’s head against the wall to get the
"jinn" out. More rarely, stabbing or cautery was used.
Some young female patients reported sexual
exploitation by FHs at their houses or at secure
hostels near shrines.
More than three quarters of the patients reported
paying fees for FHs consultation reaching up to
US$1000 or more; however, the other quarter said
that they were not asked for any fees, but that they
did give the FHs certain gifts in appreciation for
their efforts.
When probing the patients' opinions about the
benefits they gained from attending FHs,
approximately half expressed negative attitudes
towards the treatment outcomes, reflecting
discouraging experiences. Moreover, the majority
expressed reluctance to recommend their healers to
others; yet, most of them also refused to condemn
them. This ambiguous attitude might be due to the
built-in veneration of guides and masters as part of
the belief context superadded by the cultural beliefs in
traditional therapies.21
The analysis of association between variables revealed
that age and gender did not play a role in determining
visiting FHs; this was surprising as many Arab and
Muslim authors have indicated an excess of female FH
visitors.22
There was a significant association between marital
status and seeking help from FHs. Being single was
associated with an obvious tendency to visit FHs,
which may be explained by the fact that singles may
feel lonelier than married people, which may
exacerbate their desperate need to enlist different
types of assistance.
High school education was clearly associated with
lower attendance to FHs. This might give the
impression that school education has an influence on

Younis et al.

this traditional belief; however, it is difficult to rely on
this assumption as illiteracy is a rapidly growing
problem in Iraq nowadays, reaching more than 24%,
especially among females,23 which means that this
trend is unlikely to change in the near future.
There was a significant association between
psychiatric disorder type and seeking faith healing,
with depression and psychotic disorders being the
most common for visitors, while those with
conversion and obsessive compulsive disorders visited
less than was expected. This might be attributed to
the fact that presentations of psychosis are mostly
sudden and bizarre that can identify with stereotypes
of possession.17,18,19,24
It is well known that depression can present with
somatic symptoms that resemble those attributed
(as perceived by lay people) to evil eyes or witchcraft;
these include chest tightness, marital disparity,
headache, bad sleep, and nausea and vomiting, while
symptoms of conversion disorders (hysterical) are
usually interpreted by the family as medical
emergencies based on dysfunction or non-function of
certain organs or systems; this is why for these cases,
they usually seek medical help from emergency units
in general hospitals or from physicians in private
clinics.25
We dare to attribute the dominance of seeking faith
healing to the successive wars and armed conflicts
(and the resulting increasing illiteracy rates) that have
persisted in Iraq for the last four decades, yet we need
more elaborate community studies in order to confirm
our speculations. Unfortunately, no similar studies
from the pre-2003 war era were available for
comparison. The exacerbation of this phenomenon in
the last 15 years might also be linked to inadequate
health services in general, including mental health
services, attributed to many factors, the main one of
which is the noticeable shortage of psychiatrists as a
result of the flight of doctors from the country due to
repeated waves of wars and terrorism.26 A shortage
of psychiatric medications, advanced facilities for
psychotherapy and clinical psychology are additional
factors.

Limitations of the study
The major limitation was underreporting as some
patients may have hidden information about going to
FHs considering their belief in those people as "sacred"
persons; therefore, they may avoided revealing
information related to this. On the other hand, some

patients might stick with and acquiesce to the
intervention of FHs and never seek medical care,
causing an underestimation of this problem.

improve accessibility and utilization of mental health
services for this vulnerable group.

CONCLUSION

No potential conflict of interest was reported by the
authors.

Faith healing is prevalent in Iraq to the extent that FHs
may overtake the role of psychiatrists in treating
mental illnesses. Sincere efforts and collaboration of
health authorities is needed to help build public
awareness and momentum for behavior changes that
should be adopted as a national priority to develop
policy initiatives for mental health programs, and to
