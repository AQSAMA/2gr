Kumar said: “Human health is
not distinct or separate from the
ecosystems we are part of. We are
dependent on our planet’s life support
systems which provide us with clean
air, fresh water, the ability to grow
food and a stable climate. Our living
planet has a fever and if it gets much
higher, just like the human body,
its systems start to break down.
Understanding that there is no human
health without planetary health is the
critical first step to a stable and healthy
society.”2
Our coalition handed a letter to UK
Health Secretary Steve Barclay calling
for action on so-called win-wins for
health and the climate and ecological
crises (eg, plant-predominant diets,
active or shared transport, and
better insulated homes), lobbying
other departments to facilitate
those changes, along with ending
Government support for harmful new
fossil-fuel projects.
The Daily Mail interviewed Kumar and
Godlee after they spoke. Both explained
that a public health campaign on the
climate and ecological crises might
look similar to the COVID-19 campaign.
Predictably, the interview was never
used. The Daily Mail instead ran a
story on “total hypocrite” founder of
Extinction Rebellion, Gail Bradbook,
buying exotic fruit in her diesel car.3
We had spent some of our funds, out
of our own wages, commissioning art
pieces to help make our case visually:
one, involving a doctor wearing a
2·5 m mosquito costume representing
climate-induced increases in vector
borne disease, attracted considerable
public engagement. The Daily Mail
used a photo, but obscured the doctor
label on her chest and captioned it
“A woman dressed in a mosquito
costume joins Extinction Rebellion
dem­onstrators.”4 Many press outlets
appear more interested in polarising
their readership than informing them.
The consequences are confusion
and hostility towards the bearers of
uncomfortable news, which increases
political inertia with disastrous
www.thelancet.com Vol 402 October 7, 2023

consequences for our health. But
how to change that? In his lecture
A Febrile Planet, Hugh Montgomery
said that “the way people change their
behaviours is with a consistent and
consistently applied message from a
trusted vector with emotional buy-in”.5
Rather tongue-in-cheek, Mont­
gomery suggested children are the
best vector to change adult behaviour
because “they will nag you, and you will
do it because you love them”.5 However,
expecting children to protect their own
future is unfair. Nurses and doctors are
the most trusted professionals in the
world. It’s time for the profession to
get more active. It’s time for a climate
public health campaign.

Iraq’s mental health
crisis: a way forward?
For the past 20 years, mental health in
Iraq has been a difficult issue to address
as the country has faced wars, conflicts,
and political instability.1 Moreover,
Iraq has faced huge hurdles that have
substantially influenced the mental
wellbeing of Iraqi people in terms of
medical facilities, security, and the
availability of necessities such as food
and water. Over 20% of Iraqis have
mental illnesses, and that percentage is
steadily rising.2
Fear and trauma have been
widespread as the war escalated the
already high rates of violence in the
country (eg, bombings, shootings,
and kidnappings). Millions of Iraqi
people have been displaced from their
homes and neighbourhoods as a direct
result of the war. Increased rates of
depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic
stress disorder have been observed in
Iraqi people who have been uprooted
from their homes and lost friends and
relatives. According to a Baghdadbased study, most women (91·1%) in
Baghdad have experienced war-related
trauma in the past two decades.3
Furthermore, about 44% of those who
visit psychiatric clinics are women.3
Many factors have played a role in
persisting mental illnesses in Iraq. The
battle with the Islamic State of Iraq
and Syria, the growth of sectarianism,
and the persistence of political
instability have all contributed to a
tense and traumatising environment.
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic
aggravated existing mental health
issues and generated new ones in the
country—eg, social isolation, fear, and
future anxiety.4
Due to the insufficient number
of organisations in Iraq that assess,
evaluate, or intervene with suicides,
little is known about the epidemiology
of suicides or the causes of mental
illness.5 However, data show that young
women are more likely to attempt
suicide and have suicidal thoughts than
men in Iraq.6 Notably, Iraq has had a
1235

Correspondence

stand-alone policy for mental health
since 2017; however, it does not have
stand-alone or integrated strategies
or policies for suicide prevention, child
mental health, or adolescent mental
health.7 Iraq’s first-ever national suicide
prevention policy is being developed
with assistance from the International
Organization for Migration’s (IOM)
mental health and psychosocial support
programme.5 IOM held multiple talks
with domestic and international
partners before releasing the plan’s first
draft in June, 2021. IOM intends to keep
helping the Iraqi Government adopt
and carry out the country’s suicide
prevention programme after it has
been established.
The mental health system in Iraq
is not well developed. Iraq passed
legislation governing mental health
in 2005, but it has not been used
to its full potential yet. There are
only six specialised psychiatric
hospitals in Iraq (two in Baghdad
and four in the Kurdistan region),
which do not even meet the bare
minimum of the demand. Iraq has
approximately 0·34 psychiatrists per
100 000 population.8 Iraq urgently
needs mental health services as there
is a severe lack of skilled personnel
and poor infrastructure, which
severely restricts access to care. Several
difficulties confronting mental health
workers include inadequate training,
restricted access to resources, and
social stigma against working in mental
health. Because there is no public
health insurance system to cover the
entire population, the Iraqi people rely
on the central government-run public
health-care system.
To address the population’s mental
health issues, the Iraqi Government
should be urged to expand the
number of hospitals, mental health
professionals, and specialised
psychiatric facilities in each region. In
some regions, the Government has
opened clinics specifically dedicated to
mental health care, and international
organisations have contributed
financially to these efforts. There
1236

has been a gradual reduction in the
stigma associated with mental health
issues, leading more people to seek
treatment.9
However, the situation is far from
ideal. There is a severe scarcity of
mental health experts, and the Iraqi
health-care system is still trying to
keep up with population needs.2
Furthermore, many people in Iraq still
do not have access to mental health
services because of a scarcity of funding
for such programmes.
Implementing a comprehensive
and culturally relevant mental health
policy in Iraq necessitates a multifaceted approach. Community-based
mental health initiatives would
enable local health-care providers
and community leaders to detect and
address mental health issues, whereas
trauma-informed care procedures
would ensure that those who have
suffered trauma receive the proper
support. Telehealth and e-mental
health services would expand access
to mental health care, while culturally
sensitive therapies would integrate
traditional healing techniques and
involve religious leaders. Education
and awareness efforts would minimise
stigma, workplace mental health
initiatives would encourage employee
wellbeing, and resilience-building
programmes would emphasise
coping skills. Peer support networks
and stakeholder collaboration
would ensure coordinated service
delivery. Evaluation and monitoring
of these tactics regularly would
be essential for determining their
efficacy and implementing any
necessary modifications for continual
improvement. Collectively, these efforts
would reduce mental health stigma,
increase access to treatment, and
improve mental health and wellbeing
for the Iraqi population. Ultimately, this
holistic strategy would meet the unique
requirements of the Iraqi community,
thereby improving mental health and
wellbeing throughout the nation.
Now is the time for mental health
care in Iraq to be a global priority. This

prioritisation needs to take the form
of building plans and policies and
providing funding. However, provision
of national security and fighting
corruption will be the first step.
