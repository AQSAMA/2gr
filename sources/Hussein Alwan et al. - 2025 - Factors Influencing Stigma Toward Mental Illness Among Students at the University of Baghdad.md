Objective: This study aimed to identify and analyze the key factors contributing to the stigma
of mental illness among students at the University of Baghdad in Baghdad, Iraq.
Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted to achieve the
study's objectives. Study Setting: The study was conducted among university students in
Baghdad City, Iraq. A convenience sample of 300 students was included in the study. Study
Tools: Part 1: Socio-demographic characteristics, including age, level of education, monthly
family income, and number of siblings. Part 2: Quality of life was assessed using the World
Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF; World Health Organization, 2004).Part 3:
The Stigma Scale was used to measure the feelings and experiences of individuals who have
faced psychological distress, with a particular focus on societal reactions to their condition.
Findings: The mean age of the students was 22.21 ± 3.540 years, indicating that most
participants were in their early twenties. Females (61.7%) constituted a larger proportion of
the sample compared to males (38.3%). The mean score for mental illness stigma was 48.79 ±
6.811, reflecting the overall stigma perceived by students. Among the influencing factors, the
overall factors had the highest mean score (84.96 ± 14.439).
Conclusion: The study findings indicate that psychological well-being, overall health, and
strong social support play a crucial role in reducing mental illness stigma among University of
Baghdad students, with psychological factors having the most significant impact. These results
highlight the importance of comprehensive strategies to promote mental health and
effectively reduce stigma.

of suicide. Stigma towards mental disorders can be
defined as negative and discriminatory attitudes
towards people with mental disorders. This stigma can
come from various sources, including family, friends,
society, and mass media. The stigma against mental
disorders in Indonesia has become a serious concern for
the government and society (Davies, 2022).

Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
450 million people worldwide suffer from mental
illnesses, and one in every four people will be affected at
some point in their lives. This stigma can have a negative
influence on the lives of people with mental disorders,
such as judgment, social isolation, and an increased risk

Numerous universities worldwide have implemented
admissions policies to support students with disabilities
and promote an inclusive learning environment.
Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) emphasizes the
importance of mental health as a critical component of
overall well-being at all stages of life, which is consistent
with these policies (Davies, 2022).
While poor mental health creates difficulties in dayto-day living and impacts one's emotional, social,
financial, and physical well-being, good mental health
empowers people to make constructive contributions to
society. Consequently, mental health remains a
significant global public health concern (Liu et al., 2024).
Research has shown that younger college students are
more likely than older students to suffer from mental
health problems, which emphasizes the need for
increased support in educational settings (Moudatsou et
al., 2020; Staiger et al., 2018). In social psychiatry, the
term stigma refers to a set of negative factors associated
with individuals with a mental disorder. Specifically,
according to the World Health Organization, stigma
represents "a mark of shame, disgrace, or disapproval
that leads to rejection, discrimination, and exclusion
from social contexts and situations" (Ekman & Krasner,
2017; Thornicroft, 2018).
Attitudes regarding mental disease are greatly
influenced by the stigma associated with mental health,
especially among students. Numerous students have
stigmatizing views about people with mental diseases,
according to research (Ekman & Krasner, 2017). Such
stigma can have a detrimental effect on the academic and
social experiences of students who are dealing with
mental health issues. A critical determinant of the wellbeing of students with severe mental illness is peer
interactions (Thornicroft, 2018). This emphasizes how
student populations have a significant impact on how
mental illnesses are treated and how society views them
more broadly. Students who are sympathetic and
inclusive are more likely to help those who suffer from
mental illnesses and support initiatives that make it
easier for them to get the care and services they need.
Due to social, political, and cultural considerations,
stigma can be a significant deterrent for students seeking
help (Carrara et al., 2019).
Even though the number of students with disabilities
has increased dramatically worldwide, they nevertheless
face more obstacles in school than their peers without

impairments. These difficulties restrict access to
postsecondary education and career possibilities, and
they also contribute to disparities in academic
achievement (Lien et al., 2021). Eleven percent of
undergraduate students say they have a condition or
impairment that limits their capacity to engage in social
and academic activities fully. Students' quality of life
(QOL) is significantly impacted by mental health
disorders in particular (Holmqvist, 2020).
A person's physical health, social relationships,
academic achievement, and general well-being are all
impacted by psychotic disorders. Symptoms like
delusions and hallucinations frequently cause social
exclusion and misunderstanding. Patients' willingness to
seek help is influenced by several factors, including
stigma, attitudes, and the empathy of mental health
experts, even in the face of excellent therapies (Gonzalez
et al., 2017).
A higher level of internalized stigma was associated
with greater perceived discrimination, lower social
support, lower family income, older age, and distancing
coping. These factors may be essential to consider for
developing tailored interventions in the future. (Yanos et
al., 2001)
In patient care, empathy—the capacity to
comprehend and experience another person's life on an
emotional and cognitive level (Corrigan et al., 2014)—is
essential. An empathic therapist can increase
participation in treatment, promote hope, and lessen
feelings of loneliness (Corrigan et al., 2014). According to
research, patient outcomes improve and treatment
effectiveness and quality of care are enhanced when
mental health care workers have positive attitudes and
higher levels of empathy (Dalky et al., 2020; Derksen et al.,
2013). However, because people with psychotic
disorders are frequently associated with negative
stereotypes such as "unpredictable," "violent," or
"aggressive," stigma among healthcare workers can still
be problematic (Rössler, 2016). People may be deterred
from obtaining therapy due to this stigma, as they fear
discrimination (Koschorke et al., 2021).
Even among medical experts, psychotic disorders are
one of the most stigmatized mental health problems,
according to a systematic evaluation of 38 studies (Yanos
et al., 2001). Although stigma is often lower among
mental health professionals (Corrigan et al., 2014), this is
frequently because they deal directly with patients

162

Alwan et. al

(Derksen et al., 2013). On the other hand, professionals
who experience associated stigma are more
depersonalized, emotionally spent, and less satisfied
with their jobs. Additionally, it may make patients feel
more ashamed of themselves, which would make their
recuperation much more difficult (Dalky et al., 2020).
Notwithstanding these results, it is still unknown how
stigma and factors like age, occupation, education, and
years of experience among mental health practitioners
relate to one another (Yanos et al., 2001).
Cultural differences have a profound impact on
people's perceptions and experiences with severe
mental disorders (SMI), including schizophrenia.
According to research, social and environmental factors
influence both the risk and outcome of psychotic
diseases. Individuals with schizophrenia in developing
countries, such as Nigeria and India, frequently have
better prognoses—characterized by lower mortality
rates, fewer hospitalizations, and improved overall
functioning—than those in developed countries, such as
the United Kingdom and the United States (Rössler,
2016). Furthermore, non-affective acute remitting
psychosis (NARP), a subtype of schizophrenia
characterized by prolonged symptom-free intervals, is
more prevalent in developing countries. This indicates
that cultural influences, particularly gene-environment
interactions, have a substantial impact on mental health
outcomes. An aspect not to be underestimated is
"diagnostic overshadowing," the underestimation of
physical ailments in people with mental disorders
(Jablensky & Sartorius, 2008). Without appropriate
intervention measures, such as content moderation and
psychological support, social media can become an echo
chamber for these behaviors, exacerbating problems
instead of providing a way out (Silva et al., 2017).
The presence of stigma among classmates frequently
hinders students from getting the mental health care
they require, owing to fear of being judged. Addressing
the root causes of stigma and adopting interventions in
student populations can help eliminate obstacles to
mental health care (Lien et al., 2021). Fostering an open
and tolerant campus environment can lead to improved
support networks, allowing students to access needed
mental health resources without fear of prejudice.
Universities can play a crucial role in creating a more
inclusive environment that encourages students to seek

help, thereby enhancing their academic and social wellbeing.
This study aims to assess the extent of mental disease
stigma among students, providing insight into how they
perceive mental health concerns and their prevalence.
2. Identify variables contributing to mental illness
stigma among students. This entails identifying the key
factors—whether psychological, social, or physical—
that contribute to the stigma associated with mental
illness.
3. Investigate the association between psychological,
social, and physical aspects and the stigma of mental
illness among students.
Methods and Materials
Study Design and Participants
A cross‐sectional study, a descriptive design was used
for this investigation. This design is ideal for determining
the link between variables at a specific point in time,
enabling a comprehensive description of the level of
stigma and its associated components within the student
population.
The study was carried out at the University of
Baghdad in Iraq, which provides an essential backdrop
for understanding how university students in Iraq
perceive and react to mental illness stigma.
The sample includes both male and female students,
with a higher proportion of females (61.7%) compared
to males (38.3%). Regarding marital status, the majority
of participants are married (91.7%), while 7.9% are
single and 0.3% are divorced. In terms of financial status,
70.6% report having sufficient income, while 29.4% find
their income inadequate.
The majority of students (87.8%) are enrolled in
morning study programs, whereas 12.2% attend evening
studies. Regarding employment status, most students
(69.0%) are full-time students, 25.7% are self-employed,
and 5.3% are formally employed.
To determine the appropriate sample size, Slovin’s
formula was used:
n = N / (1 + Ne²)
Where n represents the required sample size, N is the
total student population, and e is the margin of error (set
at 0.05). This method ensures that the sample is
representative of the target population.
n=1+1200×0.0521200=1+31200=41200=300

A non-probability convenience sampling technique
was employed to pick 300 University of Baghdad
students. This strategy provides a realistic and
representative sample, but it may limit generalizability.
The sample size is sufficient to yield relevant results.
Instruments
The Research and Ethics Committee approved the
study involving students in the College of Nursing at the
University of Baghdad. Tools include the interviewing
questionnaire (Tool I).
The interview questionnaire was explicitly designed
to collect data relevant to the study's objectives. The
questionnaire has two parts:
1. Part 1 includes socio-demographic information
such as age, education level, monthly household income,
number of siblings, and other critical personal factors.
2. In Part 2, the WHOQOL-BREF scale (World Health
Organization, 2004) was used to assess quality of life,
which includes physical and psychological well-being.
Social relationships. Environmental factors.
• Respondents rated satisfaction on a 5-point Likert
scale (1 = dissatisfied, 5 = fully satisfied). The scale's
good internal consistency (α = .91) indicates that it
accurately measures quality of life.
•The Stigma Scale captures the feelings and
experiences of persons suffering from psychiatric
conditions, with a focus on society's reactions. This
measure was developed through qualitative research,
which included in-depth interviews with persons who
had faced mental health issues. It comprises 28
questions, each of which is graded on a scale of 0 to 4,
with higher scores indicating greater stigma.
• Questions are scored as "A" for agreement and "D"
for disagreement.
• The scale evaluates the social and psychological
effects of stigma, offering insights into societal views
towards individuals with mental health disorders.
Participants are advised to respond based on their
initial perceptions, ensuring honesty in their
representation of their experiences with stigma. This
measure can help identify areas for intervention and
guide future efforts to reduce mental health stigma in
society and healthcare settings.

A committee of five mental health nursing
professionals from the College of Nursing at the
University of Baghdad assessed the study tools to ensure
their validity. The tools were revised based on expert
comments to ensure their relevance and correctness.
Cronbach's Alpha test was used to assess the internal
consistency and dependability of the study tools, yielding
a reliability coefficient of 0.84. This suggests that the
instruments are highly consistent and reliable.
Cronbach's Alpha scores greater than 0.7 are deemed
acceptable, and a coefficient of 0.84 indicates that the
questionnaire accurately measures the target constructs.
This level of reliability improves confidence in the
accuracy of the collected data and supports the study's
findings.
Data Analysis
During the preliminary phase, the researcher
conducted a thorough evaluation of relevant literature,
which included books, scholarly articles, and both local
and international journals. The goal was to build upon
existing knowledge and identify gaps in the literature.
This review helps to modify the study methodology
and ensure that the research is anchored in existing
knowledge of mental illness stigma.
Pilot Study.
A pilot study was conducted using 10% of the target
sample (30 students) to determine the applicability and
effectiveness of the research tools. The feedback from
this pilot study was used to make required changes to the
study instruments, ensuring that they are relevant and
accurate for the full-scale study.
The fieldwork was carried out between October 2023
and January 2024. During this time, the researcher
introduced themselves to the students of the University
of Baghdad. The interview process included discussing
each item on the questionnaire to verify that the students
understood the questions and could reply correctly.
Assistance was offered when needed, and each interview
lasted around 30-40 minutes.
Findings and Results
The findings of the data analysis are presented
systematically in the following (Table 1):

Table 3 presents the factors influencing mental illness
stigma among students at the University of Baghdad.
Among these factors, psychological aspects have the
strongest negative association with mental illness stigma
(B = -0.457, Beta = -0.299, T = -5.438, p < 0.001), indicating
that better psychological well-being significantly
reduces stigma. Overall factors also show a substantial
negative influence (B = -0.135, Beta = -0.287, T = -5.189, p
< 0.001), suggesting that a combination of various
determinants contributes to lowering stigma levels.
Additionally, social aspects demonstrate a significant
negative relationship (B = -0.223, Beta = -0.241, T = 4.316, p < 0.001), implying that stronger social support
plays a key role in reducing stigma. Lastly, physical
aspects have the least impact but remain significant (B =
-0.305, Beta = -0.197, T = -3.487, p = 0.001), highlighting
the role of physical health in influencing stigma.

The figures illustrate the negative relationships
between various influencing factors and mental illness
stigma among university students. Figure 1 illustrates
the relationship between physical factors and stigma,
indicating a moderate adverse effect (R² = 0.0388),
suggesting that improved physical well-being is
associated with reduced stigma. Figure 2 presents the
strongest negative correlation, highlighting the impact of
psychological factors (R² = 0.0895), which indicates that
better psychological health significantly reduces stigma.
Figure 3 illustrates the role of social factors (R² =
0.0583), highlighting that stronger social support is
associated with lower stigma levels. Finally, Figure 4
represents the overall influence of all factors combined
(R² = 0.0821), reinforcing the idea that a holistic
approach incorporating physical, psychological, and
social well-being plays a crucial role in reducing mental
illness stigma.

Discussion and Conclusion
Our study's socio-demographic characteristics share
numerous similarities with those investigated in
"Perceived Stigma Towards Mental Illness Among
College Students of Western Nepal" by Pokharel and
Pokharel (2017). Both studies acknowledge the impact
of gender, marital status, wealth, and employment on
perceptions of mental illness stigma. In all research,
gender and socioeconomic level were identified as

significant factors in stigma, while marital status and
employment also played crucial roles in determining
views toward mental health. These findings indicate that
the impact of socio-demographic characteristics on
stigma may be similar across contexts, emphasizing the
importance of culturally responsive approaches to
addressing mental health stigma.
In addition to socio-demographic factors, Pokharel &
Pokharel (2017) underline the role of awareness and
education in reducing mental health stigma. They

167

Alwan et. al

discovered that those with higher levels of education
have more positive attitudes regarding mental health, as
opposed to people who know little about mental health
disorders (Pokharel & Pokharel, 2017). This finding
supports the value of educational interventions in
reducing stigma, since increasing information can break
down preconceptions and build empathy for persons
with mental health issues.
. Furthermore, Pokharel & Pokharel emphasized that
personal or family experience with mental illness is
essential in developing perspectives. According to their
findings, pupils who had personal or familial experiences
with mental health concerns were more likely to have a
favorable attitude regarding mental illness. This finding
emphasizes the need to encourage open discussions
about mental health, as personal exposure to mental
illness appears to play a significant role in eliminating
stigma. These findings are essential to our study because
they highlight the importance of including educational
programs and fostering conversation about mental
health to confront and change deeply ingrained
stigmatizing attitudes.
Stigma against mental disorders is a critical issue,
given, on the one hand, its influence on the well-being
and quality of life of people with mental illnesses (Dalky
et al., 2020; Jablensky et al., 1992; Koschorke et al., 2021;

knowledge, there is currently no multi-component
program aimed at reducing stigma associated with
mental diseases. The findings of this study are consistent
with those of (Ciobanu et. al., 2021), demonstrating the
substantial impact of mental illness stigma on
individuals, albeit with differences in the elements that
have
In contrast, the previous study identified emotional
and behavioral factors as the most strongly correlated
with reduced quality of life among patients. It revealed
moderate to significant negative correlations between
the Affect and Behavior domains of the SSS-S scale and
all domains of the WHOQOL-BREF (r = -0.634 to -0.741,
p < 0.01). The study found that cognitive elements had
no significant impact on quality of life. The physical and
psychological components had lower mean scores

(23.17 ± 4.398 and 20.00 ± 4.459, respectively)
compared to the social factors.
These data suggest that social factors play a more
significant role in generating stigma among students. In
contrast, emotional and behavioral elements appear to
have a greater impact on quality of life among patients.
This disparity may reflect the differences in life
experiences between students and those with persistent
mental disorders, with students being more impacted by
social beliefs and patients being more affected by their
emotional and behavioral experiences related to the
condition.
As a result, this research lends support to the idea that
mental illness stigma spreads beyond patients to other
populations, such as students. However, the factors
driving stigma differ, emphasizing the importance of
focused interventions that address the most significant
concerns for each group. Improving social support may
be important for students, whilst addressing emotional
and behavioral components is critical for patients'
quality of life.
The study "Stigma of Psychological Disorder among
University Students" sheds light on the elements that
influence mental illness stigma among students at the
University of Baghdad. The study found a substantial
negative correlation (B = -0.457, Β = -0.299, t = -5.438, p
< 0.001) between psychological well-being and stigma
related to mental illness. Social elements have a
substantial negative connection (B = -0.223, Beta = 0.241, T = -4.316, p < 0.001), indicating the need for
strong social support in minimizing stigma. Physical
elements had a substantial impact (B = -0.305, Β = -0.197,
t = -3.487, p = 0.001), underscoring the importance of
physical health in determining stigma.
Our study's socio-demographic characteristics share
numerous similarities with those investigated in
"Perceived Stigma Towards Mental Illness Among
College Students of Western Nepal" by Pokharel and
Pokharel (2017). Both studies acknowledge the impact
of gender, marital status, wealth, and employment on
perceptions of mental illness stigma (Pokharel &
Pokharel, 2017). In all research, gender and

across contexts, emphasizing the importance of
culturally responsive approaches to addressing mental
health stigma.
These studies demonstrate the multiple nature of
mental illness stigma and the need to address
psychological, social, and physical issues to minimize
stigma and improve quality of life. Interventions aimed
at these areas may help reduce stigma and enhance wellbeing among people with mental health issues.
The stigma associated with mental illness remains a
significant barrier to student well-being and access to
mental health treatments. This study investigates the
impact of psychological, social, and cultural factors on
stigma, which can lead to presumptions and a reluctance
to seek treatment. To address stigma, educational
initiatives must foster understanding, empathy, and
inclusivity. Universities play an essential role in creating
a supportive atmosphere for students, thereby
increasing their mental health and societal acceptance of
mental illness.
