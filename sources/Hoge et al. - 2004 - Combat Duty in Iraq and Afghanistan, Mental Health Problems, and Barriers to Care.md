abstract

background

The current combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have involved U.S. military personnel in major ground combat and hazardous security duty. Studies are needed to systematically assess the mental health of members of the armed services who have participated in these operations and to inform policy with regard to the optimal delivery of
mental health care to returning veterans.
methods

We studied members of four U.S. combat infantry units (three Army units and one Marine Corps unit) using an anonymous survey that was administered to the subjects either before their deployment to Iraq (n=2530) or three to four months after their return
from combat duty in Iraq or Afghanistan (n=3671). The outcomes included major depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which were
evaluated on the basis of standardized, self-administered screening instruments.

results

Exposure to combat was significantly greater among those who were deployed to Iraq
than among those deployed to Afghanistan. The percentage of study subjects whose responses met the screening criteria for major depression, generalized anxiety, or PTSD
was significantly higher after duty in Iraq (15.6 to 17.1 percent) than after duty in Afghanistan (11.2 percent) or before deployment to Iraq (9.3 percent); the largest difference was
in the rate of PTSD. Of those whose responses were positive for a mental disorder, only
23 to 40 percent sought mental health care. Those whose responses were positive for a
mental disorder were twice as likely as those whose responses were negative to report
concern about possible stigmatization and other barriers to seeking mental health care.
conclusions

This study provides an initial look at the mental health of members of the Army and the
Marine Corps who were involved in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our
findings indicate that among the study groups there was a significant risk of mental
health problems and that the subjects reported important barriers to receiving mental
health services, particularly the perception of stigma among those most in need of
such care.

t

he recent military operations in
Iraq and Afghanistan, which have involved
the first sustained ground combat undertaken by the United States since the war in Vietnam,
raise important questions about the effect of the experience on the mental health of members of the
military services who have been deployed there. Research conducted after other military conflicts has
shown that deployment stressors and exposure to
combat result in considerable risks of mental health
problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression, substance abuse,
impairment in social functioning and in the ability
to work, and the increased use of health care services.1-8 One study that was conducted just before the
military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan began found that at least 6 percent of all U.S. military
service members on active duty receive treatment
for a mental disorder each year.9 Given the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan,
mental disorders are likely to remain an important
health care concern among those serving there.
Many gaps exist in the understanding of the full
psychosocial effect of combat. The all-volunteer
force deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and the type
of warfare conducted in these regions are very different from those involved in past wars, differences
that highlight the need for studies of members of
the armed services who are involved in the current
operations. Most studies that have examined the
effects of combat on mental health were conducted
among veterans years after their military service
had ended.1-8 A problem in the methods of such
studies is the long recall period after exposure to
combat.10 Very few studies have examined a broad
range of mental health outcomes near to the time
of subjects’ deployment.
Little of the existing research is useful in guiding
policy with regard to how best to promote access to
and the delivery of mental health care to members
of the armed services. Although screening for mental health problems is now routine both before and
after deployment11 and is encouraged in primary
care settings,12 we are not aware of any studies that
have assessed the use of mental health care, the
perceived need for such care, and the perceived barriers to treatment among members of the military
services before or after combat deployment.
We studied the prevalence of mental health problems among members of the U.S. armed services
who were recruited from comparable combat units

istan. We identified the proportion of service members with mental health concerns who were not
receiving care and the barriers they perceived to accessing and receiving such care.

methods
study groups

We summarized data from the first, cross-sectional phase of a longitudinal study of the effect of combat on the mental health of the soldiers and Marines
deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Three comparable U.S. Army units were studied with the use
of an anonymous survey administered either before deployment to Iraq or after their return from
Iraq or Afghanistan. Although no data from before
deployment were available for the Marines in the
study, data were collected from a Marine Corps unit
after its return from Iraq that provided a basis for
comparison with data obtained from Army soldiers after their return from Iraq.
The study groups included 2530 soldiers from an
Army infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, whose responses to the survey were obtained
in January 2003, one week before a year-long deployment to Iraq; 1962 soldiers from an Army infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, whose
responses were obtained in March 2003, after the
soldiers’ return from a six-month deployment to Afghanistan; 894 soldiers from an Army infantry brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division, whose responses
were obtained in December 2003, after their return
from an eight-month deployment to Iraq; and 815
Marines from two battalions under the command
of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, whose responses were obtained in October or November
2003, after a six-month deployment to Iraq. The 3rd
Infantry Division and the Marine battalions had
spearheaded early ground-combat operations in
Iraq, in March through May 2003. All the units
whose members responded to the survey were also
involved in hazardous security duties. The questionnaires administered to soldiers and Marines after
deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan were administered three to four months after their return to the
United States. This interval allowed time in which
the soldiers completed leave, made the transition
back to garrison work duties, and had the opportunity to seek medical or mental health treatment, if
needed.

recruitment and representativeness
of the sample

Unit leaders assembled the soldiers and Marines
near their workplaces at convenient times, and the
study investigators then gave a short recruitment
briefing and obtained written informed consent on
forms that included statements about the purpose
of the survey, the voluntary nature of participation,
and the methods used to ensure participants’ anonymity. Overall, 58 percent of the soldiers and Marines from the selected units were available to attend the recruitment briefings (79 percent of the
soldiers before deployment, 58 percent of the soldiers after deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, 34 percent of the soldiers after deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 65
percent of the Marines after deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom). Most of those who did not attend the briefings were not available because of
their rigorous work and training schedules (e.g.,
night training and post security).
A response was defined as completion of any
part of the survey. The response rate among the
soldiers and Marines who were briefed was 98 percent for the four samples combined. The rates of
missing values for individual items in the survey
were generally less than 15 percent; 2 percent of
participants did not complete the PTSD measures,
5 percent did not complete the depression and anxiety measures, and 7 to 8 percent did not complete
the items related to the use of alcohol. The high response rate was probably owing to the anonymous
nature of the survey and to the fact that participants
were given time by their units to complete the 45minute survey. The study was conducted under a
protocol approved by the institutional review board
of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.
To assess whether or not our sample was representative, we compared the demographic characteristics of respondents with those of all active-duty
Army and Marine personnel deployed to Operation
Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom,
using the Defense Medical Surveillance System.13
survey and mental health outcomes

or for severity, and a strict (conservative) screening
definition that required a self-report of substantial
functional impairment or a large number of symptoms. Major depression and generalized anxiety
were measured with the use of the patient health
questionnaire developed by Spitzer et al.15-17 For
the strict definition to be met, there also had to be
evidence of impairment in work, at home, or in interpersonal functioning that was categorized as at
the “very difficult” level as measured by the patient
health questionnaire. The generalized anxiety measure was modified slightly to avoid redundancy;
items that pertained to concentration, fatigue, and
sleep disturbance were drawn from the depression
measure.
The presence or absence of PTSD was evaluated
with the use of the 17-item National Center for
PTSD Checklist of the Department of Veterans Affairs.4,8,18,19 Symptoms were related to any stressful experience (in the wording of the “specific
stressor” version of the checklist), so that the outcome would be independent of predictors (i.e., before or after deployment). Results were scored as
positive if subjects reported at least one intrusion
symptom, three avoidance symptoms, and two hyperarousal symptoms14 that were categorized as at
the moderate level, according to the PTSD checklist. For the strict definition to be met, the total
score also had to be at least 50 on a scale of 17 to 85
(with a higher number indicating a greater number
of symptoms or greater severity), which is a wellestablished cutoff.4,8,18,19 Misuse of alcohol was
measured with the use of a two-question screening
instrument.20
In addition to these measures, on the survey
participants were asked whether they were currently experiencing stress, emotional problems, problems related to the use of alcohol, or family problems and, if so, whether the level of these problems
was mild, moderate, or severe; the participants were
then asked whether they were interested in receiving help for these problems. Subjects were also
asked about their use of professional mental health
services in the past month or the past year and about
perceived barriers to mental health treatment, particularly stigmatization as a result of receiving such
treatment.21 Combat experiences were modified
from previous scales.22

The study outcomes were focused on current symptoms (i.e., those occurring in the past month) of a
major depressive disorder, a generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD. We used two case definitions for
each disorder, a broad screening definition that fol- quality-control procedures and analysis

0.01 to 0.38 percent). SPSS software (version 12.0)

mained significant after control for demographic
factors with the use of multiple logistic regression
(Table 3). When the prevalence rates for any mental
disorder were adjusted to match the distribution of
officers and enlisted personnel in the reference populations, the result was less than a 10 percent decrease (range, 3.5 to 9.4 percent) in the rates shown
in Table 3 according to both the broad and the strict
definitions (data not shown).
For all groups responding after deployment,
there was a strong reported relation between combat experiences, such as being shot at, handling
dead bodies, knowing someone who was killed, or
killing enemy combatants, and the prevalence of
PTSD. For example, among soldiers and Marines
who had been deployed to Iraq, the prevalence of
PTSD (according to the strict definition) increased
in a linear manner with the number of firefights during deployment: 4.5 percent for no firefights, 9.3
percent for one to two firefights, 12.7 percent for
three to five firefights, and 19.3 percent for more
than five firefights (chi-square for linear trend,
49.44; P<0.001). Rates for those who had been deployed to Afghanistan were 4.5 percent, 8.2 percent,
8.3 percent, and 18.9 percent, respectively (chisquare for linear trend, 31.35; P<0.001). The percentage of participants who had been deployed to
Iraq who reported being wounded or injured was
11.6 percent as compared with only 4.6 percent for
those who had been deployed to Afghanistan. The
rates of PTSD were significantly associated with having been wounded or injured (odds ratio for those
deployed to Iraq, 3.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.28 to 4.67; odds ratio for those deployed to
Afghanistan, 2.49; 95 percent confidence interval,
1.35 to 4.40).
Of those whose responses met the screening criteria for a mental disorder according to the strict
case definition, only 38 to 45 percent indicated an
interest in receiving help, and only 23 to 40 percent
reported having received professional help in the
past year (Table 4). Those whose responses met
these screening criteria were generally about two
times as likely as those whose responses did not to
report concern about being stigmatized and about
other barriers to accessing and receiving mental
health services (Table 5).

The demographic characteristics of participants
from the three Army units were similar. The Marines in the study were somewhat younger than the
soldiers in the study and less likely to be married.
The demographic characteristics of all the participants in the survey samples were very similar to
those of the general, deployed, active-duty infantry
population, except that officers were undersampled, which resulted in slightly lower age and rank
distributions (Table 1). Data for the reference populations were obtained from the Defense Medical
Surveillance System with the use of available rosters
of Army and Marine personnel deployed to Iraq or
Afghanistan in 2003 (Table 1).
Among the 1709 soldiers and Marines who had
returned from Iraq the reported rates of combat experiences and frequency of contact with the enemy
were much higher than those reported by soldiers
who had returned from Afghanistan (Table 2).
Only 31 percent of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan
reported having engaged in a firefight, as compared
with 71 to 86 percent of soldiers and Marines who
had been deployed to Iraq. Among those who had
been in a firefight, the median number of firefights
during deployment was 2 (interquartile range, 1 to
3) among those in Afghanistan, as compared with
5 (interquartile range, 2 to 13; P<0.001 by analysis
of variance) among soldiers deployed to Iraq and
5 (interquartile range, 3 to 10; P<0.001 by analysis
of variance) among Marines deployed to Iraq.
Soldiers and Marines who had returned from
Iraq were significantly more likely to report that they
were currently experiencing a mental health problem, to express interest in receiving help, and to
use mental health services than were soldiers returning from Afghanistan or those surveyed before
deployment (Table 3). Rates of PTSD were significantly higher after combat duty in Iraq than before

* Data exclude missing values, because not all respondents answered every question. Percentages may not sum to 100 because of rounding. Data
for the reference groups were obtained from the Defense Medical Surveillance System’s deployment rosters of Army and Marine personnel
deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Afghanistan in 2003. The total number of persons on these rosters was 315,999, of whom 229,034
(72 percent) were active-component personnel; the remaining 86,965 were members of the Reserve and National Guard; 97,906 (31 percent)
had a designation of a combat-arms occupation. Of the 229,034 active-component service members, 81,936 (36 percent) had combat-arms occupations, including 61,742 soldiers and 20,194 Marines in the reference groups.

stan. Respondents to our survey who had been deployed to Iraq reported a very high level of combat
experiences, with more than 90 percent of them reporting being shot at and a high percentage reporting handling dead bodies, knowing someone who
was injured or killed, or killing an enemy combatant (Table 2). Close calls, such as having been saved
from being wounded by wearing body armor, were
not infrequent. Soldiers who served in Afghanistan
reported lower but still substantial rates of such experiences in combat.
The percentage of study subjects whose responses met the screening criteria for major depression,

PTSD, or alcohol misuse was significantly higher
among soldiers after deployment than before deployment, particularly with regard to PTSD. The
linear relationship between the prevalence of PTSD
and the number of firefights in which a soldier had
been engaged was remarkably similar among soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, suggesting that differences in the prevalence according to location were largely a function of the greater
frequency and intensity of combat in Iraq. The association between injury and the prevalence of
PTSD supports the results of previous studies.25

combat units, which are estimated to represent
about a quarter of all Army and Marine personnel
participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan (when
members of the Reserve and the National Guard are
included) and nearly 40 percent of all active-duty
personnel (when Reservists and members of the
National Guard are not included). The demographic
characteristics of the subjects in our samples closely
mirrored the demographic characteristics of this
population. The somewhat lower proportion of officers had a minimal effect on the prevalence rates,
and potential differences in demographic factors
among the four study groups were controlled for in
our analysis with the use of logistic regression.
One demonstration of the internal validity of our
findings was the observation of similar prevalence
rates for combat experiences and mental health outcomes among the subjects in the Army and the Marine Corps who had returned from deployment to

18

Iraq, despite the different demographic characteristics of members of these units and their different
levels of availability for recruitment into the study.
The cross-sectional design involving different
units that was used in our study is not as strong as a
longitudinal design. However, the comparability of
the Army samples and the similarity in outcomes
among subjects in the Army and Marine units surveyed after deployment to Iraq should generate confidence in the cross-sectional approach. Another
limitation of our study is the potential selection bias
resulting from the enrollment procedures, which
were influenced by the practical realities that resulted from working with operational units. Although work schedules affected the availability of
soldiers to take part in the survey, the effect is not
likely to have biased our results. However, the selection procedures did not permit the enrollment of
persons who had been severely wounded or those
who may have been removed from the units for oth-

er reasons, such as misconduct. Thus, our estimates
of the prevalence of mental disorders are conservative, reflecting the prevalence among working, nondisabled combat personnel. The period immediately
before a long combat deployment may not be the
best time at which to measure baseline levels of distress. The magnitude of the differences between the
responses before and after deployment is particularly striking, given the likelihood that the group
responding before deployment was already experiencing levels of stress that were higher than normal.
The survey instruments used to screen for mental disorders in this study have been validated primarily in the settings of primary care and in clinical
populations. The results therefore do not represent
definitive diagnoses of persons in nonclinical populations such as our military samples. However,
requiring evidence of functional impairment or a
high number of symptoms, as we did, according
to the strict case definitions, increases the specificity and positive predictive value of the survey measures.26,27 This conservative approach suggested
that as many as 9 percent of soldiers may be at risk
for mental disorders before combat deployment,
and as many as 11 to 17 percent may be at risk for
such disorders three to four months after their return from combat deployment.
Although there are few published studies of the
rates of PTSD among military personnel soon after
their return from combat duty, studies of veterans
conducted years after their service ended have
shown a prevalence of current PTSD of 15 percent

20

n engl j med 351;1

among Vietnam veterans28 and 2 to 10 percent
among veterans of the first Gulf War.4,8 Rates of
PTSD among the general adult population in the
United States are 3 to 4 percent,26 which are not
dissimilar to the baseline rate of 5 percent observed
in the sample of soldiers responding to the survey
before deployment. Research has shown that the
majority of persons in whom PTSD develops meet
the criteria for the diagnosis of this disorder within
the first three months after the traumatic event.29
In our study, administering the surveys three to
four months after the subjects had returned from
deployment and at least six months after the heaviest combat operations was probably optimal for
investigating the long-term risk of mental health
problems associated with combat. We are continuing to examine this risk in repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments involving the
same units.
Our findings indicate that a small percentage of
soldiers and Marines whose responses met the
screening criteria for a mental disorder reported
that they had received help from any mental health
professional, a finding that parallels the results of
civilian studies.30-32 In the military, there are unique
factors that contribute to resistance to seeking such
help, particularly concern about how a soldier will
be perceived by peers and by the leadership. Concern about stigma was disproportionately greatest
among those most in need of help from mental
health services. Soldiers and Marines whose responses were scored as positive for a mental disor-

* Data exclude missing values, because not all respondents answered every question. Respondents were asked to rate
“each of the possible concerns that might affect your decision to receive mental health counseling or services if you ever
had a problem.” Perceived barriers are worded as on the survey. The five possible responses ranged from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree,” with “agree” and “strongly agree” combined as a positive response.

der were twice as likely as those whose responses
were scored as negative to show concern about being stigmatized and about other barriers to mental
health care.
This finding has immediate public health implications. Efforts to address the problem of stigma
and other barriers to seeking mental health care in
the military should take into consideration outreach, education, and changes in the models of
health care delivery, such as increases in the allocation of mental health services in primary care clinics and in the provision of confidential counseling
by means of employee-assistance programs. Screening for major depression is becoming routine in
military primary care settings,12 but our study
suggests that it should be expanded to include
screening for PTSD. Many of these considerations
are being addressed in new military programs.33
Reducing the perception of stigma and the barriers
to care among military personnel is a priority for
research and a priority for the policymakers, clinicians, and leaders who are involved in providing
care to those who have served in the armed forces.
