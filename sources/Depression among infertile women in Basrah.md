Abstract
Background: The extent of depression and its risk factors among infertile women may vary across different populations. The current study aimed
to examine the prevalence and risk factors of depression among infertile women in Basrah, Iraq.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including 251 infertile women who attended the infertility and in vitro fertilization unit in Basrah City.
They were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Depression was assessed by Interactional Classification of Diseases-Version 10 (ICD-10)
criteria.
Results: The prevalence of depression among infertile women was 68.9%. It was significantly related to primary type of infertility, duration of
infertility and treatment, and threat of husband's remarriage.
Conclusion: The rate of depression among infertile women in Basrah was high. Infertile women need psychological assessment and intervention
as part of their medical treatment process.

1. Introduction
Infertility is defined as “the failure to achieve a clinical
pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected
sexual intercourse.”1 The prevalence of infertility differs
greatly from one country to another, being 15% globally, >
30% in some developing countries,2 and 17e28% in industrialized countries.3 Infertility can be categorized as primary
and secondary infertility, according to whether a woman has
had a previous pregnancy or not.4 Both men and women may
have problems that might result in infertility.5 However,

irrespective of who is infertile in the couple, infertility is
considered a stressful condition, particularly for women, who
are commonly blamed for the cause of infertility,6 which affects many aspects of their lives, such as their social, physical,
and psychological well-being.7 It may even affect interest in
infertility treatment.8 The social stigma of being childless
among infertile women is so severe in some communities that
such women are neglected and socially isolated.9
The prevalence of depression in infertile women ranges
from 8% to 54%.10 Depression is thought to be a major public
health problem associated with infertility, particularly in
developing countries, where having a child is very important
for sociocultural, economic, and religious reasons.11,12
Age over 30 years, duration of infertility, low educational
level, and low social support were the main risk factors for
depression.11,13,14

problem, and the scarcity of studies on this topic in Basrah

City motivated the conduction of this study, which aimed to
examine the prevalence and risk factors of depression among
infertile women in Basrah.
2. Methods

four symptoms are present, at least two of them being key
symptoms. Moderate depression is considered if five to six
symptoms are present, two of them being key symptoms,
while depression is considered severe if seven or more
symptoms are present, including all three key symptoms.16

2.1. Study setting and design

2.4. Statistical analysis

This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted at
the infertility and in vitro fertilization unit in Basrah City over
a period of 9 months from January 1, 2013 to September 30,
2013. This study was approved by the Research and Ethics
Committee of the College of Medicine, Basrah University.

Statistical analysis of the data was done using SPSS version
19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square test (c2) or
Fisher's exact test was used to detect associations between
variables. Binary logistic regression was performed considering depression as the dichotomous variable, with the referent
category being not having depression, to identify the independent risk factors associated with depression. A p value <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

2.2. Sampling methods and sample size
A convenience sample of 275 consecutive infertile women
of reproductive age (15e45 years) attending the infertility and
in vitro fertilization unit in Basrah City were invited to
participate in the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows:
women who had failed to conceive after 1 year of unprotected
regular sexual intercourse, with no previous conception,
without using any type of contraceptive, and women who had
failed to conceive again after 1 year of unprotected regular
sexual intercourse after previously having conceived at least
once, without using any type of contraceptive.
Patients were excluded from the study if they were younger
than 15 years or older than 45 years, had attended this unit
before completing 1 year of unprotected sexual intercourse,
had been diagnosed to have a past history of depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorders prior to infertility
diagnosis, had depression secondary to any organic disorder
apart from infertility, or declined to participate.
2.3. Data collection
After participants provided informed consent, they were
interviewed using a special structured questionnaire designed
for the purpose of this study. It included information on personal data (age, duration of marriage, education, occupation,
educational level of the husband, and income), infertility
history, and social history, including if the patient was
threatened by her husband to have another marriage (wife), or
if she suffered abuse or neglect or was stigmatized. The major
depressive episodes were diagnosed according to the
Interactional Classification of Diseases-Version 10 (ICD-10)
criteria, which are reliable diagnostic criteria and internationally recognized as the gold standard.15 For a diagnosis of
depression, at least four out of 10 depressive symptoms
required to be present; three of these are key symptoms that
include persistent sadness or low mood, and/or loss of interests
or pleasures, and fatigue or low energy. The other seven
symptoms are disturbed sleep, poor concentration or indecisiveness, low self-confidence, poor or increased appetite, suicidal thoughts or acts, agitation or slowing of movements, and
guilt or self-blame. Symptoms should have been persistent for
at least 2 weeks. Mild depression is considered if a total of

3. Results
A total of 251 women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria
and were willing to participate were included in the study,
giving a response rate of 91.3%. The age of the study population ranged between 16 years and 45 years with a
mean ± standard deviation of 24.26 ± 8.5 years and a mean (±
standard deviation) marriage duration of 7.4 (± 4.5) years.
Primary infertility was prevalent in 64.9% of the study population, while 35.1% of them had secondary infertility, and
46.2% had been infertile for 5e10 years.
Depression was found to be prevalent in 68.9% of the study
population (Table 1).17e21,11,22e25,14 Of the depressed women,
42.2% had mild depression, 50.3% had moderate depression,
and only 7.5% had severe depression (Fig. 1).
The univariate analysis showed that infertility duration of >
5 years was significantly associated with depression [odds
ratio (OR), 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17e3.52;
p ¼ 0.011]. Primary infertility was also found to be significantly associated with depression (OR, 1.99; 95% CI,

1.15e3.46; p ¼ 0.013). The other variables that were found to
be significantly associated with depression were duration of
treatment and husband's threat of another marriage. All other
studied variables showed no significant association with
depression (Table 2).
Logistic regression analysis showed that the independent
significant predictors of depression were husband's threat of
another marriage, primary infertility, duration of infertility,
and duration of treatment (Table 3).
4. Discussion
The prevalence of depression among infertile women in the
current study was high compared with that reported in some
Western countries. However, it is in line with that reported in
other parts of Iraq or some Islamic or developing countries
(Table 1).
Depression is a common reaction to infertility, which often
follows the feeling of loss of identity, defectiveness and
incompetence, or a sense of social stigma.9,26 In an Eastern
country, having a child is very important for cultural, economic, and social reasons, or for religious beliefs, compared to
that in a Western country.18 In addition, differences in tests
used for assessment of depression may also be considered to

result in such variations in the prevalence of depression between different studies.
Women with a longer duration of infertility showed a
significantly higher depression rate than those with a shorter
duration (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.10e3.35; p ¼ 0.021), which
agrees with results reported by others.13,27 In the early years of
infertility, women or couples may be hopeful about the success
of medical intervention, whereas with an increase in the duration of infertility, such hope may decrease, particularly with
repeated failure of treatment and in absence of social support
from the partner or other family members.28,29 By contrast,
other studies showed either no association between depression
and infertility duration30 or weakening of association with time
due to adjustment to the condition or due to adoption.13,31,32
The type of infertility also found to have a significant association with depression. Women with primary infertility
were more depressed than their counterparts who had secondary infertility (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.19e3.73; p ¼ 0.010).
Primary infertility indicates inability to have a child, leading
to the feeling of loss of the essence of female identity and role
of motherhood, which is more traumatic to infertile woman.14
Duration of treatment was found to be significantly associated with depression (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.09e3.32,
p ¼ 0.023), a result that is in agreement with the report of
Ozkan and Baysal.33 Repeated failure of intervention combined
with financial burden may contribute to such an association.34

bad relations with their partners or other family members

usually showed higher rates of depression.19,31,35,36 In Eastern
societies, particularly Islamic ones, having a child is a crucial
factor for family stabilization. Infertile women experience
negative social and marital consequences such as divorce,
abuse, or being threatened by their husbands with another
marriage, and consequently become psychologically upset.37
In the current study, husband's threat of another marriage
was significantly associated with depression (OR, 2.61; 95%
CI, 1.18e5.79; p ¼ 0.018).
In agreement with other studies,11,23,33,38 our study showed
that depression was more common among housewives and
those with higher education level but without significant association. In closed societies such as ours, only higher education and employment may lead women to joyful aspects of
their life and help decrease psychological stress.11,37,38
In accordance with Al-Homaidan's study,11 our study
showed no association between age and depression.
One limitation of this study is that the studied women were
those who attended the in vitro fertilization unit for treatment.
Therefore the results cannot be generalized to all infertile
women in the general population.
In conclusion, the prevalence of depression among infertile
women in Basrah was high and comparable to that reported in
some other Eastern countries, but it was higher than that in
Western countries. Therefore, infertile women need psychological assessment and intervention as part of their medical
treatment process.
