Abstract
Background: Medication adherence is essential for improving the health outcomes of patients. Various patient-reported outcome
measures (PROMs) have been developed to measure medication adherence in patients. However, no study has summarized the
psychometric properties of these PROMs to guide selection for use in clinical practice or research.
Objective: This study aims to evaluate the quality of the PROMs used to measure medication adherence.
Methods: This study was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis)
guidelines. Relevant articles were retrieved from the EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CINAHL
(Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases. The PROMs were then evaluated based on the
COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines.
Results: A total of 121 unique medication adherence PROMs from 214 studies were identified. Hypotheses testing for construct
validity and internal consistency were the most frequently assessed measurement properties. PROMs with at least a moderate
level of evidence for ≥5 measurement properties include the Adherence Starts with Knowledge 20, Compliance
Questionnaire-Rheumatology, General Medication Adherence Scale, Hill-Bone Scale, Immunosuppressant Therapy Barrier Scale,
Medication Adherence Reasons Scale (MAR-Scale) revised, 5-item Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS-5), 9-item

Introduction
Medication adherence is known as “the degree to which the
person’s behaviour corresponds with the agreed
recommendations from a healthcare provider” [1]. Medication
adherence is essential when it comes to improving the health
outcomes of patients, especially for chronic diseases [2,3].
However, only approximately half of the patients worldwide
adhere to their prescribed medication regimen [4]. Reasons for
medication nonadherence include complexity of the treatment
regimen, poor communication with health care providers, and
concerns about side effects from taking medications [5]. Poor
medication adherence may lead to worse health outcomes and
higher rates of mortality and morbidity [1,6]. Nonadherence
also incurs a high cost burden to the health care system by
increasing hospital visits as well as causing unnecessary
escalation to more expensive treatments [1]. Therefore,
improving medication adherence is key to improving treatment
outcomes [7,8].
To successfully improve medication adherence, there is a need
for the accurate assessment of medication adherence. Current
practices for measuring medication include direct measures
such as drug assays of blood or urine as well as indirect
measures of adherence such as pill count, electronic monitoring
devices, and the use of big data such as review of prescription
records and claims [9,10]. Some of these measures are not time
efficient and are likely to be unsustainable in clinical practice.
Various patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) such as
the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) [11],
Hill-Bone Compliance Scale [12], and Medication Adherence
Rating Scale (MARS) [13] have been developed to measure
self-reported adherence to medications. These PROMs may be
useful in clinical practice because they are easy to administer.
On the basis of the patients’ PROM ratings, health care
professionals may be able to provide timely feedback. Thus,
underlying issues that contribute to medication noncompliance
can be addressed at the point of care [14].
A number of previous studies have been conducted to validate
PROMs on medication adherence [12,15-17], and a previous
systematic review found 14 PROMs that assessed adherence to
inhaled asthma maintenance medication alone [18]. However,
to date, there is no comprehensive review that summarizes the
psychometric properties of PROMs for medication adherence,
which is essential to guide the selection of suitable PROMs to
evaluate medication adherence in patients. Hence, we carried
out a systematic review to identify studies that investigated
https://www.jmir.org/2020/10/e19179

PROMs for medication adherence and to evaluate the quality
of these PROMs.

Methods
This study was conducted with reference to the PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and
Meta-Analysis) statement [19]. The measurement properties of
each PROM were evaluated based on the COnsensus-based
Standards for the selection of health Measurement
Instruments(COSMIN) guidelines [20,21]. The COSMIN
guidelines evaluate PROM development and the following 9
measurement properties: “content validity,” “structural validity,”
“internal consistency,” “cross-cultural validity/measurement
invariance,” test-retest “reliability,” “measurement error,”
“criterion validity,” “hypotheses testing for construct validity,”
and “responsiveness” [21,22]. Of note, the assessment of
“convergent
validity,”
“discriminant
validity,”
and
“known-group validity” falls under “hypotheses testing for
construct validity” [23,24]. We also assumed that “concurrent
validity” and “predictive validity” can be evaluated by the same
measurement property, “hypothesis testing for construct
validity,” and sensitivity to change can be evaluated under
“responsiveness” as well [22,25,26].

Search Strategy
The EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science,
and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant studies
published before November 1, 2019. A search strategy
(Multimedia Appendix 1) consisting of adherence, PROMs,
and measurement properties was used. Search filters created by
Terwee et al [27], which consists of a combination of search
terms, were also used to enhance the sensitivity of searches,
where available. For the adherence construct, synonyms such
as compliance were used in the search. Duplicates were removed
from the final search library.

Study Selection
Articles included in this study were full-text publications in
English, validating medication adherence PROMs, with the
assessment of at least one measurement property listed in the
COSMIN [24,28]. We excluded animal studies, case studies,
narrative reviews, expert opinions, conference abstracts, and
PROMs completed by proxy [29]. In total, 2 independent
reviewers (SW and LO) screened the titles and abstracts of the
studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Opinions from a third reviewer (YK) were sought in the event
of any disagreements. The remaining full-text articles were then
J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 10 | e19179 | p. 2
(page number not for citation purposes)

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
evaluated by the same 2 independent reviewers for inclusion
and exclusion. Additional articles for inclusion into the final
pool of articles were also identified from the reference list of
articles during the full-text screening phase [30].

Extraction of Data
The following data were then extracted from the included
articles by 2 independent reviewers (SW and LO), where
available:
•
•
•

General characteristics of the study population: age, sample
size, gender, and country.
Characteristics of disease or condition: disease studied,
duration of illness, or treatment.
PROM characteristics: methods of administration,
availability of electronic administration, language, response
scale, domains, and number of items.

Assessment of Methodological Quality
The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by 2
independent reviewers (SW and LO). Any disagreement was
resolved in consultation with a third reviewer (JP). Each
measurement property was assessed based on a 4-point scale:
“inadequate,” “doubtful,” “adequate,” or “very good” [20,22].
The item with the worst rating under each measurement property
would determine the overall rating for the specific measurement
property [31].
On the basis of the COSMIN guidelines, it is recommended for
the review team to determine before assessing the
methodological quality of studies which outcome measurement
instrument can be considered a reasonable gold standard [32].
The study team decided that there is currently no gold standard
in the field of patient-reported outcomes that measure
medication adherence [33,34]; thus, the assessment of criterion
validity of the PROMs was not performed except when an
abridged PROM was compared with the original long version,
which will be regarded as the gold standard. This is in line with
the consensus from the COSMIN panel that no gold standard
exists for PROMs [35].

Assessment of Psychometric Quality
The psychometric quality for each medication adherence
instrument was assessed using the quality criteria by Terwee et
al [36]. For each of the measurement properties evaluated in
the included studies, a “positive (+),” “indeterminate (?),” or

https://www.jmir.org/2020/10/e19179

XSL• FO

Kwan et al
“negative (−)” rating was assigned based on the psychometric
results.For example, for the internal consistency measurement
property, the rating will be “+” if “at least low evidence for
sufficient structural validity AND Cronbach’s alpha(s) ≥ 0.70
for each unidimensional scale or subscale.” The rating will be
“−” if there is “at least low evidence for sufficient structural
validity AND Cronbach’s alpha(s) < 0.70 for each
unidimensional scale or subscale.” The rating will be “?” if the
“criteria for at least low evidence for sufficient structural validity
is not met” [36].

Evidence Synthesis
For each PROM, an evidence synthesis across studies was
conducted. First, we determined whether each measurement
property for a PROM had overall “sufficient (+),” “insufficient
(−),” “inconsistent (±),” or “indeterminate (?)” evidence for
each measurement property of the PROM. For PROMs that
were assessed in more than one study, the overall rating of the
level of evidence for the PROM would be sufficient (+),
indeterminate (?), or insufficient (–) if the individual studies
were all consistently rated as positive (+), indeterminate (?), or
negative (-), respectively. If the results of individual studies
were inconsistent, the overall rating of the level of evidence for
the PROM would be inconsistent.
We also graded the quality of evidence for each measurement
property of PROM as “high,” “moderate,” “low,” or “very low”
level of evidence based on the guidelines from the modified
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation approach for systematic reviews of clinical trials
[22,37].

Results
Search Results and Study Characteristics
In total, 51,426 articles were retrieved from the 5 databases.
After removing 8286 duplicates and 42,836 articles during title
and abstract screening, 304 articles remained for full-text review.
A total of 98 articles were further eliminated during full-text
article screening. An additional 8 relevant articles were
identified through hand-searching of the reference lists from
the included articles to obtain a final list of 214 articles (Figure
1). A total of 240 PROMs were evaluated across 214 studies,
and 121 unique medication adherence PROMs in 32 languages
from 48 countries were identified (Table 1).

PROM Characteristics
The characteristics of the medication adherence PROM are
presented in Multimedia Appendix 2 [38-51]. The most
extensively studied PROMs were the 8-item MMAS
(MMAS-8)and 4-item MMAS(MMAS-4), which were studied
in 27 and 18 studies, respectively. Among the 121 PROMs, 15
PROMs have been administered electronically—Adult AIDS
Clinical Trials Group (AACTG) adherence items [52],
Fredericksen et al [38], Item Response Theory-30 [53],
LeastAbsolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-10 [53],

Assessment of Methodological and Psychometric
Quality
Outcomes on the assessment of methodological quality and
study quality of PROMs are summarized in Multimedia
Appendix 3 [13,17,38-54,56,57,59,61-248]. In terms of validity,
“hypotheses testing for construct validity,”“structural validity,”
and “content validity” were assessed in 181, 92, and 92 studies,
respectively. In terms of reliability, “internal consistency” and
“reliability” were assessed in 138 and 27 studies, respectively.
No studies assessed “measurement error” or “cross-cultural
validity/measurement invariance.”Of note, 46 studies performed
translation of PROMs, but none of them assessed measurement
invariance or differential item functioning. Furthermore,
although 75 studies assessed PROM development, only one of
them obtained very good methodological quality.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review
that comprehensively summarized PROMs for medication
adherence based on the COSMIN guidelines [21,22]. Among
the 214 included articles, we identified 121 unique PROMs for
medication adherence. Our study revealed the most commonly
evaluated medication adherence PROMs to be the MMAS-8,
MMAS-4, AACTG, MARS, and MARS-5. However, being
more commonly evaluated does not mean that these PROMs
have the best psychometric properties. Moreover, based on the
number of studies for each PROM in Table 2, most of the
PROMs have too few studies to provide a strong evidence base
for their use.
Among the 15 PROMs that have been administered
electronically, 3 PROMs (MAR-Scale revised, MMAS-4, and
MMAS-8) have at least a moderate level of evidence for ≥5
measurement properties. Electronic administration of PROMs
to measure medication adherence may be appealing in health
care settings, as it may reduce the administrative burden for
data collection and data entry. In addition, as web-based
interventions to improve medication adherence become
increasingly commonplace [250], electronic PROMs may be
incorporated into web-based platforms to assess the effectiveness
of these web-based interventions.

Despite a few studies claiming the use of certain PROMs and
objective measures as the gold standard for measuring
medication adherence, we deliberately omitted evaluating
criterion validity for these studies. As mentioned in the
introduction, although objective measures such as pill count,
electronic monitoring devices, and big data may measure
adherence indirectly, these measures are laborious, costly, and
sometimes invasive, making them unsuitable for routine clinical
use. Furthermore, all these surrogate measures, including
PROMs, do not predict any real biological outcomes such as a
reduction in viral load, blood pressure, or glucose concentration
in determining medication adherence in patients. Hence, none
of these measures can be deemed as a gold standard [10].
Measurement error was not evaluated because none of the
studies reported the standard error of measurement, smallest
detectable change, or limits of agreements required by the
COSMIN. In addition, although translations of PROMs were
performed in 46 studies, none of these studies assessed
measurement invariance or differential item functioning;
therefore, cross-cultural validity was not evaluated for any of
the PROMs in this study. Moreover, only one study examined
the interpretability of PROMs in the form of minimal detectable
change for the MMAS-8 [251]. Further study on measurement
error, cross-cultural validity, and interpretability of medication
adherence PROMs is warranted.
The strengths of this study include using COSMIN guidelines,
which are well regarded as a consensus-based standard for

evaluating the measurement properties of PROMs [23]. The
COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist employed in this study is an
improvement from the original COSMIN checklist with several
improvements in the standards for evaluation [21,22]. We also
used sensitive search filters to retrieve and include as many
potentially relevant articles as possible.
One limitation related to this study was that the selection of
articles and evaluation of psychometric properties were
subjective in nature and may have been prone to judgment bias.
Nevertheless, the requirement by COSMIN to have 2
independent reviewers and the need for a third reviewer to reach
a consensus in the case of any discrepancy occurring has helped
reduce the risk of judgment bias [22,252].

Kwan et al

Conclusions
In summary, 121 unique medication adherence PROMs were
identified in 214 studies. On the basis of the COSMIN
guidelines, PROMs with at least a moderate level of evidence
for ≥5 measurement properties include the ASK-20, CQR,
GMAS, Hill-Bone Scale, ITBS, MAR-Scale revised, MARS-5,
MARS-9, MMAS-4, MMAS-8, SEAMS, SICT, TAI, and
questionnaire by Voils. Of these, only the GMAS has sufficient
(+) ratings for at least four measurement properties. We believe
this study would assist clinicians and researchers in selecting
suitable PROMs to measure medication adherence among
patients. Future research may consider validating measurement
errors and cross-cultural validity to further improve the insights
on the measurement properties of these PROMs.
