Community pharmacist attitudes towards
collaboration with general practitioners:
development and validation of a measure and
a model
Connie Van1*, Daniel Costa2, Penny Abbott3, Bernadette Mitchell1 and Ines Krass1

Abstract
Background: Community Pharmacists and General Practitioners (GPs) are increasingly being encouraged to adopt
more collaborative approaches to health care delivery as collaboration in primary care has been shown to be
effective in improving patient outcomes. However, little is known about pharmacist attitudes towards collaborating
with their GP counterparts and variables that influence this interprofessional collaboration. This study aims to
develop and validate 1) an instrument to measure pharmacist attitudes towards collaboration with GPs and 2) a
model that illustrates how pharmacist attitudes (and other variables) influence collaborative behaviour with GPs.
Methods: A questionnaire containing the newly developed “Attitudes Towards Collaboration Instrument for
Pharmacists” (ATCI-P) and a previously validated behavioural measure “Frequency of Interprofessional Collaboration
Instrument for Pharmacists” (FICI-P) was administered to a sample of 1215 Australian pharmacists. The ATCI-P was
developed based on existing literature and qualitative interviews with GPs and community pharmacists. Principal
Component Analysis was used to assess the structure of the ATCI-P and the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used
to assess the internal consistency of the instrument. Structural equation modelling was used to determine how
pharmacist attitudes (as measured by the ATCI-P) and other variables, influence collaborative behaviour (as
measured by the FICI-P).
Results: Four hundred and ninety-two surveys were completed and returned for a response rate of 40%. Principal
Component Analysis revealed the ATCI-P consisted of two factors: ‘interactional determinants’ and ‘practitioner
determinants’, both with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .90 and .93 respectively). The model
demonstrated adequate fit (χ2/df = 1.89, CFI = .955, RMSEA = .062, 90% CI [.049-.074]) and illustrated that
‘interactional determinants’ was the strongest predictor of collaboration and was in turn influenced by ‘practitioner
determinants’. The extent of the pharmacist’s contact with physicians during their pre-registration training was also
found to be a significant predictor of collaboration (B = .23, SE = .43, p <.001).
Conclusions: The results of the study provide evidence for the validity of the ATCI-P in measuring pharmacist
attitudes towards collaboration with GPs and support a model of collaboration, from the pharmacist’s perspective,
in which collaborative behaviour is influenced directly by ‘interactional’ and ‘environmental determinants’, and
indirectly by ‘practitioner determinants’.

Background
Interprofessional collaboration involves individuals from
different disciplines working together while contributing
to patient care from their own professional perspective
[1]. It is now widely recognised that in order to provide
adequate care for chronically ill patients, health providers
must work together to improve and prevent gaps in service delivery [2]. General practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacists are increasingly being encouraged to
adopt more collaborative approaches to health care delivery as collaboration between GPs and pharmacists has
been shown to be an effective means of improving patient
care by helping patients achieve therapeutic goals [3-5]
and enhancing medication management [6-8]. Research
to date has tended to focus on the effect of GPpharmacist collaboration on patient outcomes [9-11].
Limited attention has been paid to GP and pharmacist
attitudes towards collaboration. This subject is important
as a practitioner’s attitudes towards collaboration may influence the degree to which they collaborate with their
counterpart.
Existing measures of attitudes towards interprofessional
collaboration

Currently, only one validated measure of pharmacistphysician collaboration exists. The “Physician-Pharmacist
Collaboration Instrument” developed by Zillich et al. [12]
for physicians is a 14-item instrument developed using
literature from interpersonal, business, and health care
relationships and covers seven themes: collaborative care,
commitment, dependence, symmetry, bidirectional communication, trust, initiating behaviour, and conflict resolution. The instrument was tested and validated on a
sample of US physicians practicing in family medicine,
internal medicine and paediatrics. The instrument was
later adapted for pharmacists, and tested for sensitivity
and criterion validity on a small (n = 25) sample of community pharmacists [13]. More recently, Hojat & Gonnella [14] developed the “Scale of Attitudes Towards
Pharmacist-Physician Collaboration.” The instrument has
yet to be validated but preliminary psychometric analysis
has been carried out on a small (n = 42) sample of retail
pharmacists, hospital pharmacists and physicians
affiliated with a tertiary institution. The 16-item instrument was designed for administration to pharmacists,
physicians and students of pharmacy and medicine. The
instrument was based on ‘frequently mentioned components of collaboration in the literature’ and some items
were adapted from an existing physician-nurse collaboration instrument.
Although the two instruments discussed above cover
many dimensions of collaboration (many of which are
relevant to the primary care setting), they were not specifically designed for community pharmacists practicing

Page 2 of 10

in primary care and therefore do not address all dimensions of collaboration relevant to this sector. For example
the “Physician-Pharmacist Collaboration Instrument” [12]
does not address lack of GP recognition of the pharmacist’s role in medication management - a theme that
has been frequently reported as a barrier to collaboration between physicians and pharmacists practising in primary care [15-18] and the “Scale of Attitudes Towards
Pharmacist-Physician Collaboration” [14] does not cover
the dimension of trust. Each instrument also has other
limitations worth noting. The “Physician-Pharmacist Collaboration Instrument” [12] was developed and validated
using one group of practitioners only i.e. physicians. The
instrument must be modified for pharmacists but has
only been tested on a small sample for this purpose [13].
On the other hand, the “Scale of Attitudes Towards
Pharmacist-Physician Collaboration” [14] was designed to
be administered to physicians and pharmacists practicing
in various settings, as well as students. As a result the instrument is more general i.e. the items refer to physicians
and pharmacists in general terms as the same items need
to be applicable to a broad population. Due to this design,
the instrument does not tap into important personal
aspects of a collaborative relationship such as trust and
respect between two practitioners.
Existing theoretical models for interprofessional
collaboration

The drive for collaboration in the provision of healthcare
has also led to the development of a number of models
that conceptualise collaborative behaviour [19-23]. These
models include those that describe factors influencing
collaboration as well as those that describe the different
stages and characteristics of collaboration mostly in a
nursing context. Only a limited number of models have
described the dynamics of collaboration between physicians and pharmacists [24,25]. The “Collaborative
working relationship model”, proposed by McDonough
and Doucette [24], is a general model for physicians
and pharmacists. The model describes collaboration as
an evolving process consisting of five stages: stage 0 –
professional awareness, stage 1 – professional recognition, stage 2 – exploration and trial, stage 3 – professional relationship expansion and stage 4 – commitment
to the collaborative working relationship. The model also
posits that the drivers of collaboration include participant, context and exchange characteristics. More recently,
Bradley et al. [25] developed a “Conceptual model of
GP-pharmacist collaboration” specifically for GPs and
community pharmacists, consisting of three stages: stage
1 – isolation, stage 2 – communication and stage 3 – collaboration, with key components of collaboration identified as locality, service provision, trust, ‘knowing’ each
other, communication, professional roles and respect.

The stages of the “Collaborative working relationship
model” was synthesised from existing models of interpersonal relationships, including theories of social exchange, business relationships and collaborative care
models primarily relating to nurses and physicians, rather than drawn from physician and pharmacist’s own
accounts of their collaborative relationships [24]. The
proposed drivers of collaboration however have been
tested [26]. In contrast, the “Conceptual model of GPpharmacist collaboration” was derived from interviews
with GPs and community pharmacists in the UK however the model has not yet been tested [25].
Study aims

The aims of the study were to develop and validate, in
the context of primary care in Australia 1) an instrument
to measure pharmacist attitudes towards collaborating
with GPs and 2) a model that illustrates how pharmacist
attitudes (and other variables) influence collaborative behaviour with GPs.
A corresponding instrument that measures GP attitudes towards collaborating with pharmacists will be
reported in a separate paper (manuscript under review).

Methods
Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Sydney Human Ethics Committee prior to commencement
of the study.
Theoretical background

Initially, qualitative interviews with GPs and pharmacists
were conducted to explore the nature, extent and determinants of collaborative interactions between pharmacists and GPs. Details of this study have been published
in an earlier paper [15]. To summarise, interactions between pharmacists and GPs involved administrative
issues associated with the dispensing process, exchange
of patient and drug information and discussion of
patients’ drug therapy. Factors which appeared to influence collaborative behaviour concurred with previous
studies [26-33], and included either ‘interactional’,

Page 3 of 10

‘practitioner’ or ‘environmental determinants’. ‘Interactional determinants’ comprise those components of
interpersonal relationships, ‘practitioner determinants’
include elements related to the GP or pharmacist individually and ‘environmental determinants’ describe the
conditions under which the practitioner practices.
Based on the qualitative interviews [15] and existing literature on interprofessional collaboration [20-24,34,35],
a hypothesised model for collaboration between pharmacists and GPs was developed (Figure 1).
Development of the attitudes towards collaboration
instrument for pharmacists

Generation of the items of the Attitudes Towards Collaboration Instrument for Pharmacists (ATCI-P) was
based on the hypothesised model (Figure 1) which was
guided by existing literature on interprofessional collaboration [20-24,34,35], and pharmacist and GP interviews
[15]. The preliminary version of the ATCI-P contained
21 items which covered ‘interactional’, ‘practitioner’ and
‘environmental determinants’. This version of the ATCIP was distributed to 8 community pharmacists and 2
health services researchers with extensive experience in
community pharmacy and general practice. This group
was asked to comment on the face and content validity
of the questionnaire, the appropriateness of the response
options, whether items needed to be modified, removed
or added as well as how the layout of the survey could
be improved. Based on the feedback, modifications were
made to the preliminary ATCI-P before it was pilot
tested on 224 pharmacists in New South Wales, Australia. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with oblimin
rotation was then utilised to provide information regarding how each item contributed to the measurement of
the construct. Items were evaluated for inclusion, exclusion or modification based on factor loadings, correlations and the interpretability of the item in relation to
the extracted factor. Careful consideration of the PCA
results led to a refined 15-item ATCI-P (Table 1).
For the refined ATCI-P, respondents were asked to indicate on a 5-point scale the extent to which they agreed

Australia. Australian postcodes were used to search online telephone directory White PagesW to generate a list
which included all pharmacies in the database. One
thousand two hundred and fifteen pharmacies were then
selected and mailed a questionnaire addressed to ‘The
Pharmacist’. The sample size (n ≥420) was calculated
based on the number of responses required for Structural equation modelling (SEM) i.e. at least 10 responses
per parameter estimate, then doubled to allow for a split
sample validation analysis. Based on a response rate of
38% from a previous study [36], the minimum number
of pharmacies that needed to be surveyed was calculated
to be 420 / 0.38 = 1105.
Data collection

The questionnaire was sent to the sample of 1215 pharmacies. The purpose and procedures of the study were
described in an introductory letter included with the
questionnaire and pharmacists were requested to return
the survey in a reply-paid, self-addressed envelope.
Questionnaires were marked with an ID number to
allow for a follow-up/reminder mailing. Three weeks
from the date the initial survey was distributed, all nonrespondents were sent a reminder letter and another
copy of the survey to complete. To encourage participation, respondents were entered into a draw for a chance
to win one of four prizes: a double gold class movie pass,
a bottle of champagne, a $100 shopping voucher or an
iPod nano.
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis (PCA and SEM) was conducted using
SPSS and AMOS 18.0. A preliminary analysis provided
baseline descriptive statistics. Cases with missing data on
variables of interest (FICI-P items, ATCI-P items and
asterisked items presented in Table 1) were then
removed and the sample was randomly divided into two
groups. Sample 1 was used for initial testing of the structural model and Sample 2 was used for validation. The
factor structure of the ATCI-P was investigated using
PCA on Sample 1. The results from the PCA and
the hypothesised theoretical model were used to guide
the development of an empirically testable model to describe what influences interprofessional collaboration between GPs and pharmacists from the pharmacist’s
perspective. The previously validated FICI-P [36] was
used as a measure of pharmacist collaboration with GPs.
The 10 items of the FICI-P were added to produce a
score which represented pharmacists’ frequency of interprofessional collaboration with GPs and formed a basis
for the construction of the model. The proposed model
was then tested on Sample 2. The fit of the model was
assessed using three indices:

Page 5 of 10

a) Relative Chi-square (χ2/df ): Used to determine the fit
of the data to the model adjusted for the complexity
of the model. Adequate model fit is obtained when
χ2/df <3.
b) Root Mean-Square Error of Approximation
(RMSEA) with 90% confidence level: Used to assess
absolute fit of the model. Adequate model fit is
obtained when RMSEA <0.08.
c) Bentler Comparative Fit Index (CFI): Used to assess
incremental fit. Adequate model fit is obtained when
CFI >0.90 [37].
Internal consistency of the two factors of the ATCI-P
was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha.

Results
Four hundred and ninety-two surveys were completed
and returned for a response rate of 40%. Respondent
characteristics are presented in Table 2. The gender and
age distribution is similar to that reported in the 2006
Australian Census [38] which found 47% of retail pharmacists to be male and 39% to be aged 45 years or older.
The distribution of pharmacists by state/territory is also
similar to that reported in the Australian Government
Department of Health and Ageing Annual Report 2005–
2006 [39]. When cases with missing data (described
above) were removed, 468 cases remained for analysis.
PCA on Sample 1 (n = 234) produced a two factor solution (Table 3). ATCI-P items 1,2,4,8,9,10,11,13,14 and
15 made up Factor 1 and ATCI-P items 3,5,6,7 and 12
made up Factor 2. The items clustered together in a
similar fashion as predicted (Table 1) with the exception
of two themes: ‘recognition of roles’ (ATCI-P 11, 13 and
14) which loaded on ‘interactional determinants’ and
‘trust’ (ATCI-P 6 and 12) which loaded on ‘practitioner
determinants’ in the PCA. As a result, Factor 1 was labelled as ‘interactional determinants’ and Factor 2 as
‘practitioner determinants’. Both factors showed good
internal consistency with ‘interactional determinants’
and ‘practitioner determinants’ having a Cronbach’s
α = .903 and .930 respectively (calculated using Sample 1
data).
Results from the PCA were used to guide the construction of the structural model for interprofessional
collaboration. Figure 2 shows the structural model with
the individual items of the ATCI-P and factor loadings,
combining the original structural model with the final
modified structural model. The original structural model
consisted of the sum of the 10-item FICI-P, the 15 items
of the ATCI-P and 5 other observed variables (asterisked
items in Table 1). The model fit of the original structural
model (using Sample 1 data) was poor (χ2/df = 3.13,
CFI = .82, RMSEA = .096, 90% CI [.087-.104]). The best
model fit was obtained with the removal of 3 of the 5

observed variables, correlation of the ATCI-P items
(based on theme, see Table 1) and the addition of a direct path from ‘practitioner determinants’ to ‘interactional determinants’ (rather than from ‘practitioner
determinants’ to ‘Collaboration between pharmacist and
GPs’). When the original structural model was modified
this way, model fit improved (χ2/df = 1.89, CFI = .956,
RMSEA = .062, 90% CI [.049-.074]). When this modified
structural model was tested on Sample 2 (n = 234),
model fit was also adequate (χ2/df = 1.89, CFI = .955,
RMSEA = .062, 90% CI [.049-.074]). ‘Proximity to GP’s
office’ and some of the modeled covariances, however,
were not significant (Figure 2).
Figure 3 presents the modified structural model in a
simplified format similar to the hypothesised model in
Figure 1.

Discussion
The results of the study provide evidence for the validity of
the ATCI-P in measuring attitudes towards collaboration
and illustrate the relationship between the frequency of
interprofessional collaboration and ‘interactional’, ‘practitioner’ and ‘environmental determinants’. The structural
model (Figure 2) describing these relations was modified
and tested on a validation sample, and displayed adequate
fit statistics. ‘Interactional determinants’ and an ‘environmental determinant’ were shown to influence collaboration
directly, while ‘practitioner determinants’ was found to indirectly influence collaboration. ‘Interactional determinants’
was found to be the strongest predictor of pharmacist collaboration with GPs, and was in turn strongly influenced by
‘practitioner determinants’.
PCA of the ATCI-P indicated that items making up
the variable ‘trust’ belong to ‘practitioner determinants’
rather than ‘interactional determinants’ as initially
hypothesised (Figure 3). This may be because trust is
linked to the individual rather than their interaction; that
is, these items entail the pharmacist’s assessment of the
GP, rather than an assessment of their interactions. It
may be argued that a positive assessment of a practitioner is in fact a prerequisite for strong interactions. In
contrast ‘recognition of roles’ was found to belong to
‘interactional determinants’ rather than ‘practitioner
determinants’. This may be because perceptions on role
affect how practitioners interact with one another.
Regarding the ‘environmental determinants’, only
‘physician contact during training’ was found to be a
predictor of collaboration. The item asks pharmacists
whether during their pre-registration training they
rarely, occasionally or frequently had contact with GPs
(if training was carried out in community pharmacy) or
medical officers (if training was carried out in hospital
pharmacy). Those pharmacists who had frequent contact
with GPs and/or medical officers during their pre-

registration training were more likely to have higher
levels of collaboration with their GP counterpart in their
current practice. This may suggest that exposure to collaboration during the final year of pharmacist training
equips pharmacists with the skills and confidence for future collaboration.

When ‘proximity to GP’s office’ was modelled as a predictor of collaboration using Sample 1 data, those pharmacists working in closer proximity to their GP
counterparts were found to have higher levels of collaboration than isolated practitioners. This may be because
being geographically closer to one another provides

more opportunity to develop rapport and positive relationships as a result of increased interaction. However
when ‘proximity to GP’s office’ was modelled and tested
on the validation sample (Sample 2), the impact of this
variable was not replicated. As this variable has been
identified as important in previous studies [15,27], and
significantly impacted on collaboration when modelled
using Sample 1 data, it should not be disregarded but
may be worth investigating in future research.
This study has several important implications for practice and highlights possible strategies for improving
interprofessional collaboration between pharmacists and
GPs. Policy makers may wish to consider strategies for
fostering good communication, trust and respect between GPs and pharmacists. One strategy may be to restructure primary health care services so that GPs and
pharmacists are collocated. This would make them more
accessible to one another and thereby increase opportunities for interprofessional collaboration. For pharmacist collaboration with GPs to be successful there must
also be a willingness from both parties to work together.
This may be nurtured by creating educational opportunities that allow pharmacists more interaction with their
medical colleagues in their formative years to build confidence and encourage teamwork. It would also allow
GPs to recognise and appreciate that pharmacists have
an important contribution to make to medication safety
and effectiveness.
Several limitations to the study should be noted: firstly,
the response rate of 40% was only modest however the
size of the sample was adequate for the analysis. Secondly,
the items that make up the instruments are reflective of
current primary care practice and may require refinement
if changes to practice occur in the future. This, however,
is not a shortcoming of the theoretical model proposed,
but rather a qualification that the specific items employed
in the model must align with current practice. It should
also be noted that the ATCI-P and model have been

developed for community pharmacists practicing in Australia. Validity testing of the ATCI-P and model for other
settings e.g. ambulatory and tertiary settings; for other
practitioners e.g. GPs or hospital pharmacists; and in
other countries may yield different results and requires
further research. Finally, as pharmacists have different
interactions with different GPs it was necessary to ask the
respondents to think of only one GP when completing
the questionnaire. Respondents were asked to ‘think of
the GP with whom you have most dealings’. Therefore,
the results may be biased towards reflecting the relationship of more actively collaborating pharmacist and GP
pairs than that of the average population.

Conclusions
The results of the study provide evidence for the validity
of the ATCI-P in measuring attitudes towards collaboration and support a model of collaboration in which
collaborative behaviour is influenced directly by ‘interactional’ and ‘environmental determinants’, and indirectly
by ‘practitioner determinants’. The proposed model provides valuable insight and a good foundation for policy
makers, researchers and practitioners to develop strategies for pharmacists to improve collaboration with GPs
in the interest of quality use of medicines and improved
health outcomes. The FICI-P and ATCI-P may also be
useful tools for determining the extent of collaboration
in current practice and will allow for empirical assessment of interventions targeted at enhancing pharmacist
collaboration with GPs.

for Pharmacists (FICI-P)

1. The GP and I openly communicated with each other.
2. I informed the GP of new products/services that are

11. My role and the GP’s role in patient care are clear.
12. I have confidence in the GP’s medical expertise.
13. The GP believes that I have a role in assuring
medication safety (for example, to identify drug
interactions, adverse reactions, contraindications
etc).

dose etc).
15. My working together with the GP benefits the
patient.
Note: In answering both the FICI-P and ATCI-P
items, respondents were asked to ‘think of a GP with
whom you have most dealings’. In answering the FICI-P
items, respondents were asked to ‘estimate the number
of times the following has occurred in the last month’
on a 4-point response scale, where 1 = ‘nil’, 2 = ‘1-2

times’, 3 = ‘3-4 times’ and 4 = ‘5 or more times.’ In
answering the ATCI-P items, respondents were asked to
‘indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with
the following statements’ on a 5-point response scale,
where 1 = ‘strongly disagree’, 2 = ‘disagree’, 3 = ‘neither
agree nor disagree’, 4 = ‘agree’ and 5 = ‘strongly agree’.
