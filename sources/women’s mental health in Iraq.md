exclusive. For example, one could speculate that cigarette
smoking might increase cannabis use, which in turn might
directly aﬀect schizophrenia risk. In our opinion, this
explanation is unlikely because there is still no evidence of
an association of CHRNA5-A3-B4 variants with cannabis
use. Any evidence that cigarette smoking is a risk factor
for schizophrenia would not preclude that tobacco might
also be used to self-medicate symptoms or side-eﬀects of
medication. Nevertheless, these recent genetic ﬁndings,
if conﬁrmed, would have profound implications and
require us to fundamentally revise our understanding
of the association between cigarette smoking and
schizophrenia. If cigarette smoking is a risk factor for
schizophrenia, this ﬁnding will form an important public
health message. Moreover, the understanding of the
mechanism underlying this association will be crucial
(eg, whether schizophrenia develops due to the eﬀects
of nicotine or other constituents of tobacco smoke).
Mendelian randomisation analyses will not be able to
answer these questions, although in principle, a similar
analysis of users of pure nicotine products could. In view
of the growing use of electronic cigarettes, the answers
to these questions will inform ongoing public health
policy debates about nicotine products and their ability to
reduce the burden of smoking-related diseases.

Tears of Ishtar: women’s mental health in Iraq
Iraq was the seat of culture, knowledge, and art in the
ancient Arab world. In the past few decades, Iraq has dealt
with a large share of violence in the region due to three
major wars: ﬁrst the Iraq–Iran War from 1980 to 1988,
then the Gulf War in January, 1991, and most recently,
the US-led invasion in March, 2003. These conﬂicts have
had a serious eﬀect on women in Iraq, yet mental health
services are generally inadequate. According to the WHOAIMS report1 on mental health systems in Iraq, 44% of
psychiatric outpatient visits are by women, and many
more women seek help from faith healers or primary care
clinics for minor psychological problems. Although the
www.thelancet.com/psychiatry Vol 2 February 2015

ratio of psychiatrists per 100 000 people increased from
0·1 in 1998 to 0·7 in 2007, the number of psychiatrists
in Iraq is still much lower than the international
standard.2 Furthermore, women prefer to consult female
psychiatrists for religious and social reasons. The number
of female psychiatrists increased from eight (7%) of
110 psychiatrists in 2001 to 44 (29%) of 150 psychiatrists
in 2014 (unpublished data communicated by the Iraqi
Council for Medical Specializations, Ministry of Higher
Education and Scientiﬁc Research, Baghdad 2014).
Despite the increase in female specialists for health
service, the public demand is still not met.

An Iraq family health survey study3 of 9345 households
between 2006 and 2007 indicated that the rate of deaths
by all causes in women aged 15–59 years increased from
0·83 per 1000 women before the March 2003 invasion
to 1·95 per 1000 women in the post-invasion period
(March, 2003, to June, 2006). Sectarian conﬂict and
terrorism internally displaced more than 1·5 million Iraqis
and forced another 2·5 million into exile as refugees in
neighbouring countries.4 The more recent invasion of
radical Islamic militants and counteracting air strikes
have created a new wave of refugees. Many women in
Iraq are illiterate (prevalence of 76·7% compared with
45·1% for men) and live in poverty. Additionally, tribal and
cultural traditions, especially in rural areas, might lead to
increased susceptability to all kinds of mental disorders.5
The Iraqi State Ministry for Women’s Aﬀairs reports that
recent wars and violence created about 900 000 widows,
representing 9% of the country’s female population. Only
86 000 of these women receive the widow’s pension
equivalent to US$140 per month. The government oﬀers
no shelter or employment facilities for these women.
Women are also the direct victims of violence: women
are killed or severely injured during bombardment by
the occupying forces, kidnapped for ransom, or arrested
for political or sectarian reasons. The tragic story of
Abeer Al-Janabi, a 14-year-old Iraqi girl who was raped
and subsequently burned with her family by ﬁve American
soldiers in March, 2006, aroused anger and immense
feelings of humiliation throughout Iraq.
Despite international support and WHO’s plans to
develop the existing mental health system in Iraq, these
psychological traumas in women have not been addressed
adequately, apart from a few studies that referred to
gender imbalances in mental disorders.6–8 The absence of
data describing the severity of mental disorders in women
and the stigmatisation of mental illness are barriers to

eﬀective development of mental health policy.4 Gender
imbalances in mental disorders in Iraq should be studied
on a large scale to inform future strategy.
Various initiatives are underway in Iraq to improve the
provision of mental health care to women, particularly
by training more female mental health workers. The Iraqi
Scientiﬁc Council for Medical Specializations adopted
a policy to encourage young female doctors to take up
this specialty, to accept more women to the training
programme, and to allow women to choose their
training centres and their appointment location after
specialisation in cooperation with the Iraqi Ministry of
Health. At the Baghdad Teaching Hospital, we recruit
female psychologists and social workers to deliver
multidisciplinary health care and help in psychoeducation
of female patients, especially those aﬀected by warrelated trauma. Although integration of mental health
into primary health care was the main goal of WHO and
the Iraqi mental health authority,1,4 it was actually not
implemented. Sincere eﬀorts by the Ministry of Health to
promote a public mental health model for women should
be made by arrangement of basic psychiatric training for
medical and nursing staﬀ working in primary health care
units throughout the country.1,4,5 Women’s mental health
clinics should be established in the main cities. Mental
health promotion in general and outreach activities
should be encouraged. Inspiration and guidance can be
drawn from experiences in other low-income and middleincome countries that report similar circumstances.9 All
stakeholders are requested to widen the professional base,
strengthen the contribution and role of female mental
health workers, and link with other community sectors.

As we commemorate the centenary of World War 1
and the oﬃcial withdrawal of UK military troops from
Afghanistan, the fate of former armed forces personnel
has come into sharp focus once again. Most of the
current generation of personnel who leave service
make successful transitions back into civilian life.
However, some personnel do not. A proportion will
develop mental health problems, and some will ﬁnd
themselves involved in the Criminal Justice System.
In view of the Armed Forces covenant,1 there is an
expectation that more should be done to support the
entire military family.
An independent review2 by Stephen Philips on behalf
of the Secretary of State for Justice addresses former
Armed Forces personnel in the Criminal Justice System.
This review was inspired by a rising concern about the
proportion of former Armed Forces personnel in prison
and on probation for violent and sexual oﬀences.3,4
Results from a study5 showed that, although overall
oﬀending in the UK military was less than expected
in a comparable sample of the general population,
violent oﬀending did not follow this trend and was
overrepresented in the military sample.
The review involved wide consultation with experts
in research, mental health, social care, criminal justice,
and legal matters and emphasises the need for national
guidance on the identiﬁcation and management of
former Armed Forces personnel in the Criminal Justice
System. The recurring theme in the recommendations
is a call for more training for those working within the
Criminal Justice System and judiciary in understanding
the needs of former Armed Forces personnel.6 The review
acknowledges the integral link between poor mental
health, alcohol and substance misuse, and oﬀending
behaviour.4,5 The review recommends better collaboration
between criminal justice and mental health agencies,
both within the National Health Service and the third
sector. The review also emphasises the need for greater
support and interventions, not just during time in prison
www.thelancet.com/psychiatry Vol 2 February 2015

and probation,7 but also earlier in the criminal justice
pathway. The review clearly states that identiﬁcation
of former Armed Forces personnel throughout the
Criminal Justice System is patchy and in some instances
nonexistent. We welcome the recommendations to
improve data capture and recording.
Although comprehensive in scope, the review was
largely reliant on verbal evidence from a range of
witnesses, including ourselves. Unfortunately, there
is insuﬃcient evidence on which to base recommendations for speciﬁc policy and interventions for former
Armed Forces personnel in the Criminal Justice System.
We appreciate that the dynamics of reports and inquiries
demands recommendations for swift action at the end
of the process and that the call for more research is rarely
attractive to politicians, practitioners, and journalists
alike. But sometimes a call does need to be made. To
be fair, the inquiry drew attention to work in progress
on domestic violence and advised Parliament to
acknowledge and act on this work. However, the review
falls short in not making any other recommendations
towards research on eﬀective interventions to
ameliorate oﬀending behaviour in ex-service personnel
sooner. Similarly, no call for a better understanding of
causal factors was made to build on what is only a small
existing body of literature.5,7,8
Access to a good evidence base is an essential
component of any policy making and delivery. We can
build on the existing evidence base for “what works” to
reduce reoﬀending in the general oﬀender population.9
The background risk proﬁle of oﬀenders who are former
Armed Forces personnel is similar to that of other
oﬀenders (ie, young males from deprived areas of the
country and who have a history of oﬀending).5 However,
particular challenges in management of former Armed
Forces personnel in the Criminal Justice System might
arise from their experiences in the military, during
deployment, from associated mental health problems,
and from the socioeconomic, cultural, and health eﬀect
