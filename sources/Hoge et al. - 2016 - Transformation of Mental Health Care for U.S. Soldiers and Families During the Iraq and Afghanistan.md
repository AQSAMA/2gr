The cumulative strain of 14 years of war on service members,
veterans, and their families, together with continuing global
threats and the unique stresses of military service, are likely to
be felt for years to come. Scientiﬁc as well as political factors
have inﬂuenced how the military has addressed the mental
health needs resulting from these wars. Two important differences between mental health care delivered during the
Iraq and Afghanistan wars and previous wars are the degree
to which research has directly informed care and the consolidated management of services. The U.S. Army Medical
Command implemented programmatic changes to ensure
delivery of high-quality standardized mental health services,
including centralized workload management; consolidation
of psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric nursing, and social
work services under integrated behavioral health departments; creation of satellite mental health clinics embedded
within brigade work areas; incorporation of mental health

War has historically been a crucible that catalyzes advances
in medical care. The recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are
no exception, producing the highest survival rates for wounded
service members with breakthroughs in acute hemorrhage
management, forward surgical support, and rapid air evacuation. These wars have also generated unparalleled efforts
compared with past conﬂicts to mitigate the immediate and
long-term neurological and psychological effects of war. At
the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions, senior Army
and Department of Defense (DOD) leaders invested in research to measure the mental health impact and shape the
development of clinical policies and programs. Studies conducted during these wars have shown that the risks of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and other mental
health problems are comparable to past wars (1, 2). Research on
stigma and barriers to care have led to multiple efforts to
enhance access. Studies have led to increased awareness of the
interaction between concussion (mild traumatic brain injury
[TBI]) and PTSD (3, 4), and protocols for the treatment of
battleﬁeld concussions were implemented for the ﬁrst time.
Since 2007, Congress has appropriated unprecedented resources for the DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) to support mental health research and clinical treatment.

providers into primary care; routine mental health screening
throughout soldiers’ careers; standardization of clinical outcome measures; and improved services for family members.
This transformation has been accompanied by reduction in
psychiatric hospitalizations and improved continuity of care.
Challenges remain, however, including continued underutilization of services by those most in need, problems with
treatment of substance use disorders, overuse of opioid medications, concerns with the structure of care for chronic postdeployment (including postconcussion) symptoms, and
ongoing questions concerning the causes of historically
high suicide rates, efﬁcacy of resilience training initiatives,
and research priorities. It is critical to ensure that remaining
gaps are addressed and that knowledge gained during
these wars is retained and further evolved.

Of all service branches and coalition forces, the U.S. Army
has borne the greatest burden of ground combat operations,
contributing 1.5 million personnel-years to Afghanistan and
Iraq deployments between 2001 and 2011, compared with less
than 1 million for all other services combined (Navy, Marines,
Air Force) (5). The Army has also led the standardization and
programmatic transformation of mental health care on the
battleﬁeld and at home, and Army research has had an ongoing inﬂuence on health care policy and practices across the
DOD and VA.
The purpose of this article is to delineate key milestones in
the transformation of mental health care for soldiers and their
families, including how developments were directly informed
by research as well as political factors. This article is intended
to provide a road map through a body of literature important in
understanding lessons concerning the provision of mental
health services for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars,
as well as preparation for future conﬂicts.
KEY RESEARCH INVESTMENTS

psychologists, in addition to clinicians, trained to deploy and
conduct research relevant to maintaining the health and
readiness of the force. Building on experience gained during the Bosnia and Kosovo deployments (6) and through
partnership between operational research psychologists,
clinicians, and epidemiologists, the Army initiated a major
research effort in 2002 to measure the mental health and
neurological impact of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. An
inﬂuential component of this investment was the Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research Land Combat Study, which
produced publications in top-tier journals (for both mental
health and TBI) (2, 3, 7), provided data presented in multiple
Congressional testimonies, and supported serial anonymous
mental health assessments of Army and Marine operational
personnel collected during deployment (8, 9). Key ﬁndings
from the Land Combat Study included benchmarks of the
prevalence of PTSD, depression, and other mental health
problems before, during, and after deployment; critical
ﬁndings on stigma perceptions and barriers to care; illumination of the complex interrelationship between battleﬁeld
concussions, PTSD, and postdeployment symptoms; and
documentation of inadequate distribution of mental health
services in the deployed environment that led to major revisions of doctrine, training, and personnel management (2, 3,
7–9). The methodology applied in the study for estimating
PTSD prevalence (2) became the standard for hundreds of
other research initiatives, facilitating comparisons across
studies throughout these wars (1, 10, 11). A meta-analysis of
studies from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars found a weighted
average postdeployment PTSD prevalence of 5.5% in all
deployed personnel (all services and nations, including
support personnel) and 13.2% in line infantry units (1).
At the DOD level, the ﬂagship epidemiological investment
is the Framingham-like Millennium Cohort Study (11–13),
initiated in 2000 to address ongoing health concerns of
veterans of the ﬁrst Gulf war (1990–1991). The Millennium
Cohort Study is the largest prospective collection of health
data on current and previously serving military personnel
from all branches of service. Originally scheduled to run
21 years, the study was modiﬁed to include additional waves
of service members every 3 years during the current wars, and
it is now scheduled to continue for the lifetime of most
participants (until 2067) (14). Additional DOD research investments followed as a result of increased Congressional
funding starting in 2007, including several large multicenter
research consortiums focused on clinical trials to reﬁne or
improve evidence-based treatments for PTSD or postconcussion symptoms (14). These included the Injury and
Traumatic Stress Consortium, the South Texas Organizational Network Guiding Solutions on Trauma and Resilience,
and the University of Texas Health Science Center and
National Center for PTSD Consortium to Alleviate PTSD.
The Army also funded a large epidemiological study, the
Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service Members, to try to identify modiﬁable causes of increased rates of
suicide among soldiers (15).

HISTORICAL HIGHLIGHTS, 2002–2009
The following timeline details research initiatives that directly inﬂuenced mental health care during the Iraq and
Afghanistan wars and the most important instances when
media exposure and politics intersected to catalyze key policy
and programmatic decisions. This is not a comprehensive
review of all research or high-visibility events resulting from
these wars, but rather a highlight of studies and events that
had direct inﬂuence on transforming the mental health care
system. Table 1 provides a summary of key milestones in this
historical overview.
2002–2003
Before 2002, mandatory postdeployment mental health
screening consisted of a single question that asked whether
service members had sought or intended to seek mental
health counseling. In 2002, a cluster of murder-suicides at
Ft. Bragg, N.C., involving soldiers who served in the initial
Afghanistan ground operation made international headlines
(16). The Army investigative team ﬁndings, combined with
experience with early screening efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo
(6), catalyzed a new deployment cycle support process, including the DOD decision to revise deployment screening.
The 2003 postdeployment health assessment included, for
the ﬁrst time, questions on depression, PTSD, and safety
(suicidal and homicidal ideation) (17).
2004–2005
An enhanced postdeployment screening pilot study conducted
by investigators at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
showed that soldiers were disinclined to report mental health
concerns immediately on return from deployment, but a signiﬁcantly higher proportion reported concerns 3–4 months
later (18). As a result, in March 2005, the DOD expanded
deployment screening to include a second assessment, the
postdeployment health reassessment, 3–6 months after deployment (19). The Army also initiated research to better
validate these screening instruments and provide guidance
for effective implementation and further research (19–22).
2005–2006
Before 2005, mental health clinicians working in the deployed environment (known as combat-operational stress
control personnel) were divided into prevention and treatment teams, which was confusing and inefﬁcient for
geographically dispersed units. Findings from the ﬁrst two
anonymous mental health assessments in Iraq demonstrated
outdated policies and inadequate distribution of mental
health personnel, with limited or no services to remote locations (8, 9). These ﬁndings, combined with a shift from a
divisional war-ﬁghting structure to smaller, more maneuverable brigade combat teams, led to extensive revisions of
Army doctrine and training to support the mental health
needs of deployed soldiers. Changes included revision of
combat-operational stress control ﬁeld manuals (23, 24) and

reorganization of training and distribution of mental health
personnel across the battleﬁeld. The ﬁeld manuals also for the
ﬁrst time included guidance on the use of psychotropic medications in theater, which had previously been discouraged.
The number of mental health professionals directly assigned to
combat brigades was increased, and combat-operational stress
units were divided into smaller teams distributed throughout
theater that could each provide the full range of services. Mental
health providers from other military services were also called
upon to augment Army units. No previous era has seen as much
direct forward-deployed mental health support to frontline
troops.
In 2006, media reports emerged asserting that the DOD
was deploying personnel who were not mentally ﬁt (25),
leading to policies that established mental health deployment
standards. A program evaluation was then conducted using a
quasi-experimental design; units that received close care
coordination combined with mandatory screening according
to the new standards experienced signiﬁcantly better mental
health outcomes during deployment than comparable units
that did not have care coordination (25). Approximately 3%
of deployed soldiers were taking psychotropic medication,
most commonly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for
depression or anxiety, and a key component of program effectiveness was likely the active coordination of reﬁlls through the
336

ajp.psychiatryonline.org

medical chains of command (rather than waiting for soldiers to
come forward to ask for them).
2007
Along with emerging knowledge on stigma and barriers to
care, the Washington Post published a pair of articles exposing
poor living conditions and problems with wounded warrior
care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. News stories from
Ft. Carson, Colo., also raised concerns about soldiers with
PTSD being inappropriately separated under administrative
regulations. These articles ultimately led to the resignation
of an Army Surgeon General, revision of administrative
separation policies, Congressional testimonies, and high-level
investigative commissions and task forces (26–28). Army research ﬁndings on the prevalence of mental health problems, stigma, and low utilization of services contributed to the
recommendations of these committees (2, 8, 9, 17, 19). The end
result was acknowledgment that existing clinical programs
and stafﬁng were insufﬁcient to meet the mental health needs
of returning service members. In response, Congress appropriated nearly $1 billion in 2007 for PTSD and TBI
research and enhancement of treatment capabilities. This
decision was followed by sustainment of higher funding in
subsequent years, providing the necessary resources to drive
the transformation of services. The increased funding also led
Am J Psychiatry 173:4, April 2016

HOGE ET AL.

to research consortiums and establishment of the Defense
Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and TBI, an
organization tasked with providing leadership, knowledge,
and coordination between the services and the VA. An unparalleled number of clinical trials involving psychotherapy
or pharmacotherapy interventions and new delivery models
(e.g., telemedicine) were initiated (14).
2008–2009
With the inﬂux of resources, new challenges emerged. Local
solutions to address deﬁciencies in psychological and TBI care
proliferated at military posts, resulting in over 200 programs
across the DOD that were poorly integrated, inefﬁcient, or
redundant (29). A 2008 study by the RAND Corporation was
highly inﬂuential in heightening concerns about deploymentrelated TBI (30), although the scientiﬁc validity of the report’s
19% TBI prevalence estimate in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans
was questionable (31, 32). New programs also included
nonmedical initiatives, such as the Army’s Comprehensive
Soldier and Family Fitness program to enhance resiliency, as
well as alternative counseling options (e.g., Military Family
Life Consulting, Military One-Source) to assist with occupational, relationship, grief, or family problems conﬁdentially.
The DOD and the VA increased collaboration to promote
evidence-based practices, including publication of clinical
practice guidelines for PTSD and mild TBI (33, 34), and the
Army initiated a major effort to consolidate best practices and
standardize mental health services across the enterprise.
TRANSFORMATION OF ARMY MENTAL HEALTH
CARE: 2010–TODAY
Centralized Management and Reorganization of Services
Until 2010, the primary authority responsible for determining
the number of mental health personnel and types of services
was held by each commander at more than 30 different military
treatment facilities worldwide. Hospital commanders, military
providers, and unit leaders also rotated frequently between
posts and deployments. As a result, wide variance developed in
the continuity, structure, size, scope, and quality of clinical
programs, as well as in coordination of care for soldiers with
occupational impairment. Furthermore, services at most facilities were divided into separate departments of psychiatry, psychology, and social work. This stovepiped and
poorly integrated system was confusing to patients, leaders,
and other clinical specialties. To improve standardization
and coordination of service delivery, policies, programs, and
training, all mental health services (inpatient, outpatient, and
residential) were consolidated under a program management
ofﬁce at the Ofﬁce of the Army Surgeon General and Medical
Command Headquarters in San Antonio, Tex., named the
Behavioral Health Service Line. The intent was to implement
a cost-effective, sustainable, outcome-focused system of care
to ensure high-quality, efﬁcient, and standardized services
across the Army with clearly deﬁned performance indicators.
This system followed a public health model that incorporated
Am J Psychiatry 173:4, April 2016

population-based screening and enhanced services across the
care continuum (including primary care). Discipline-speciﬁc
departments at each installation were reorganized into single,
integrated behavioral health departments, each under one
clinical chief, mirroring the integrated practice units operating in other sectors of medicine (35). Clinical programs now
comprised providers from all specialties oriented around
the needs of patients, rather than provider disciplines. Coordination between treatment facilities within the same region and with the management team was enhanced through
regional behavioral health directors. Systems were also established, through electronic processes and care managers, to improve continuity of services for soldiers undergoing deployments
or transfers between posts.
Behavioral health services across the Army were consolidated under 10 core programs: inpatient, outpatient/
multidisciplinary, intensive outpatient services, residential
care for substance use disorders, tele-behavioral health care,
family advocacy, and four novel programs (described below)
focused particularly on enhancing and coordinating access
(embedded behavioral health, behavioral health in primary
care, and school-based behavioral health) and standardizing
outcomes (the Behavioral Health Data Portal). A major emphasis on hiring increased the number of mental health
providers across the Army from approximately 1,300 in 2007
to more than 3,000 today. Tele-behavioral health resources
were expanded to provide regional support for primary care
and mental health providers and direct care to sites with
limited resources both in-theater and garrison. Electronic
workload tracking and budget tools were implemented in 2013.
These systems (visible to managers at every level) monitor
each provider’s clinical capacity and productivity compared
with Army-wide standards, consolidate resourcing and staffing levels for mental health care, set expenditure parameters
for each facility, and include facility incentives aligned with
clinical outcome priorities.
Novel Behavioral Health Programs
Embedded behavioral health. In 2009 and 2010, the Army
piloted embedded behavioral health, a mental health care
delivery model, at Ft. Carson in an effort to decrease stigma,
reduce barriers, and enhance care coordination. Leveraging
lessons from in-theater embedded medical and mental health
care (8, 9) (including the long history of embedded surgeons
and primary care professionals), this program created small,
multidisciplinary satellite mental health clinical teams assigned
to combat-deployable units at their home locations and
co-located the teams proximal to where soldiers worked. A
2010–2011 program evaluation by the U.S. Army Public
Health Command identiﬁed signiﬁcant correlations between
implementation of the embedded teams and reductions in offpost mental health referrals, inpatient hospitalizations, and
soldier risk behaviors, as well as an increased proportion of
soldiers considered psychiatrically ﬁt for deployment (36).
These ﬁndings were attributed to improved access and continuity of care and enhanced communication between mental
ajp.psychiatryonline.org

337

TRANSFORMATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR U.S. SOLDIERS AND FAMILIES

health providers, primary care, and unit leaders. The ﬁndings
were also consistent with a quasi-experimental study that
demonstrated the effectiveness of care coordination between
garrison and deployed settings (25) and an evaluation by a
health care systems team from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. As a result, additional pilot efforts were initiated,
and in January 2012, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army
directed expansion of embedded behavioral health teams to
all installations where deployable combat brigades reside.
Currently 54 functional teams are in place, each supporting a
brigade-size unit, at 18 installations.
Behavioral health in primary care. Another key initiative to
reduce stigma and enhance access, ﬁrst introduced in 2006 at
Ft. Bragg and subsequently expanded Army-wide, was a pilot
project called Re-Engineering Systems of Primary Care for
PTSD and Depression in the Military, based on collaborative
care models tested originally in civilian populations (37). This
pilot involved screening for depression, PTSD, and alcohol
misuse in primary care, telephone consultation with mental
health professionals, and care management. Beginning in
2011, the program transitioned to a structure that involved
licensed mental health professionals embedded directly within
primary care clinics. Currently, nearly 100 mental health
professionals working in 48 primary care clinics Army-wide
are providing consultation to primary care providers, clinical
assessments, triage, and brief cognitive-behavioral interventions. A large randomized trial conducted at six installations
is assessing the effectiveness of additional care management
enhancements, stepped treatment (including web and telephone options), and more intensive outcome management
compared with usual care (38).
Child and family behavioral health system. While the volume
of research was growing on the impact of the wars on soldiers,
studies also documented the impact on military children and
spouses (39, 40). In response, family services were expanded
through a program that includes consultation to primary care,
outreach, screening, treatment for family members, and mental
health services delivered directly in primary and secondary
schools located on military installations. Currently, mental
health professionals are working directly in 45 schools on
Army posts.
Behavioral Health Data Portal. With the growth in number
of providers with varying levels of training and experience,
the ability to systematically monitor practice outcomes and
treatment effectiveness was needed. Beginning in 2012, after
several years of pilot efforts, the Army deployed a web-based
application named the Behavioral Health Data Portal across
Army mental health clinics. This system collects standardized patient self-assessments on initial entry into mental
health care and at every follow-up visit via electronic notebooks or tablets accessed by patients at clinic check-in.
Currently, over 70% of outpatient mental health appointments for soldiers Army-wide are associated with standardized
338

ajp.psychiatryonline.org

clinical outcome measures. These include Patient Health
Questionnaire depression measures, generalized anxiety measures, the Primary Care PTSD screen, the PTSD Checklist, the
Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test, and a brief version of
the Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The data portal
also incorporates a new functional impairment measure
developed by Army researchers for working populations (41).
The portal enables mental health providers to view clinical
outcome data and trends real-time during each appointment,
assess treatment effectiveness, and give immediate feedback
to patients. The system also links with Army occupational
data that track deployment readiness, including postdeployment health assessments, and it includes an algorithm to assist
with coordination of care for soldiers transferring to other
posts. Aggregate data are available across treatment facilities
and regions, allowing linkage with electronic medical records
for routine surveillance and program evaluation efforts. The
data portal was recently mandated by the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Health Affairs for expansion to the Air Force and
the Navy.
Additional Core Program Components
Screening initiatives across a soldier’s career. In addition to
routine screening for common mental disorders (depression,
PTSD, substance use disorders) in primary care, further
modiﬁcations to the mandatory DOD deployment screening
have occurred as a direct result of emerging Army research
and Congressional mandates. In 2011, a two-stage screening
process for PTSD and depression was introduced because of
concerns about predictive validity (21), and the screening
questions for mild TBI used on the deployment surveys
(which were also used in the 2008 RAND prevalence study
[30]) were extensively revised based on evidence that they
were invalid for clinical screening purposes (3, 31, 32, 42).
Health care policies to facilitate standards of care. Army health
care policies attempted to balance organizational needs for
standardization based on existing best practices and clinical
guidelines (33) with expected variation in providers’ interpersonal styles, patient preferences, and standards of care,
as well as evidence that lack of therapeutic efﬁcacy was most
often due to dropout from treatment. Research informed
these policies, including studies of stigma and reasons for
treatment dropout (43) and a survey of Army mental health
professionals that showed high training and use of evidencebased treatments but low ﬁdelity to all core manualized
techniques (44). These results were used to develop a PTSD
treatment policy that fostered a modular approach emphasizing patient and provider choice in selecting treatment
options (to enhance retention) while also requiring clinicians
to document how they provided the core components of
evidence-based interventions intrinsic across different manualized protocols (45). This is more ﬂexible than the VA policy
approach, which emphasizes strict provider adherence to two
manualized therapies (cognitive processing and prolonged
exposure). In addition, an Army study directly comparing

PTSD diagnostic criteria provided clinicians with militaryspeciﬁc guidance on applying deﬁnitional changes in DSM-5
(45, 46).
Revision of disability evaluations. Although disability evaluations are not managed under the Behavioral Health Service
Line, Army mental health providers routinely conduct
evaluations that contribute to determinations of soldiers’
ﬁtness for duty and disability. In late 2011, problems with the
disability evaluation system came to light after allegations
from 14 soldiers that their PTSD diagnoses had been changed
by Army mental health evaluators at Ft. Lewis, Wash., leading
to reduction or denial of beneﬁts (47). As a result, the Army
conducted an investigation of all disability evaluations since
2001 and offered reevaluations to more than 400 soldiers who
had potential adverse changes to their PTSD diagnosis. Of 257
who elected to participate in the re-evaluation, the diagnosis
of PTSD was upheld in over half (47). The Army evaluation
paralleled a DOD-level review that ultimately led to major
revisions in policies and procedures, including integration of
DOD and VA disability evaluation processes and establishing
the VA evaluation as the evaluation of record (greatly reducing administrative burdens of parallel systems).
PROGRAM EVALUATION
Given that the Behavioral Health Service Line is relatively
new and being implemented simultaneous to the drawdown
of forces in Afghanistan, it is difﬁcult to prove that the revised
structure of care has been solely or directly responsible for
Am J Psychiatry 173:4, April 2016

improved outcomes. However, the transformation was
clearly necessary, and certain programmatic outcomes suggest beneﬁts. Table 2 lists total outpatient and inpatient
behavioral health care encounters, inpatient bed days, and the
percentages of soldiers who received a follow-up appointment within 7 and 30 days after discharge from an inpatient
mental health hospitalization from 2010 to 2014. While the
active-duty population has decreased by approximately 8%
since its peak in 2011, and ambulatory behavioral health
encounters have decreased by a similar proportion, total
psychiatric hospitalizations and bed days have fallen more
than 20% through reductions in purchased services. The
proportion of soldiers who received an outpatient appointment within 7 days after inpatient discharge rose from 92% to
95% between 2012 and 2014, far exceeding benchmarks in
civilian systems of care.
A recent study of trends in stigma perceptions over the
course of these wars documented signiﬁcant improvements
in stigma as well as traditional access barriers (e.g., appointment availability) (48). These improvements, which started
before implementation of the Army-wide transformation of
care, are probably related to a number of factors, including
routine primary care and deployment-related screening,
education campaigns by senior leaders, research efforts,
and media attention.
CHALLENGES AND CRITICAL GAPS
Although mental health efforts for service members have
been unprecedented compared with those made during past
ajp.psychiatryonline.org

339

TRANSFORMATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR U.S. SOLDIERS AND FAMILIES

conﬂicts, many challenges remain, including continued underutilization of mental health services (43), problems with
treatment of substance use disorders (49), concerns with
chronic pain and prescription opioid misuse (50), and lack of
clarity on optimal strategies to address overlapping postdeployment physical and cognitive symptoms being attributed (or likely misattributed) to concussion (3, 4, 31, 32, 42,
51). Studies in both the DOD and the VA show that despite
improvements in screening and stigma perceptions, a large
percentage of service members and veterans still do not seek
mental health care when needed or do not receive an adequate number of treatment encounters for recovery (43).
Emerging research indicates that the reasons for this gap
appear to be much more complex than initial studies suggested. In particular, not seeking or dropping out of treatment
are more stronglyassociated with preferences for self-sufﬁciency
and negative perceptions of mental health treatment than traditional conceptualizations of stigma or barriers identiﬁed at the
beginning of the wars (43, 52, 53).
A considerable portion of the PTSD and TBI research
investment over the past 8 years has been directed toward
establishing the infrastructure to support large consortiums
and multicenter trials (in addition to the infrastructure for the
DOD Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and TBI).
However, the science has not necessarily evolved to the point
of prioritizing multicenter trials (54), and the investment
structure may have dampened innovative initiatives from
individual investigators or smaller organizations. Excellence
is also not established solely through an organization’s name
or structure. A large proportion of funding for PTSD clinical
trials has been directed toward reﬁning, improving, or validating
existing evidence-based treatments in military populations,
particularly prolonged exposure and cognitive processing
therapy, despite high dropout rates among veterans receiving
these treatments (54). In contrast, research is lacking on
veteran preferences for care. There has not been a single
clinical trial of eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy or narrative exposure therapy, two wellestablished evidence-based PTSD treatments used throughout
the world (33, 54), in veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars. Promising emerging approaches that have a strong
scientiﬁc rationale, such as accelerated resolution therapy
(a variant of eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing
that preliminary evidence suggests may result in faster recovery with a lower dropout rate [55]), have received little
attention. Despite massive research investment and highly
specialized interdisciplinary TBI programs (e.g., the National
Intrepid Center of Excellence), non-evidence-based treatments for persistent TBI-attributed symptoms predominate,
and clinical research on TBI is plagued by deﬁnitional
problems and poor selection of control groups (4, 31, 56). No
new treatment for blast- or impact-related postconcussion
symptoms has been identiﬁed, and we are not aware of a
single clinical trial in a military or veteran population to
validate or reﬁne treatment known to be most effective in
preventing chronic postconcussion symptoms in civilian
340

populations (i.e., education to promote expectations of recovery) (34). Critical research priorities include the validation of interventions to improve treatment engagement and
retention, further testing of innovative treatments, and collaborative primary care strategies (4, 51, 54).
Clinical trials of primary care-based models of treatment
for postdeployment health concerns are likely the only path
to optimizing postconcussion care, a lesson forgotten from
the ﬁrst Gulf war. Problems such as opioid overprescribing,
polypharmacy, and probable misattribution of postdeployment symptoms to concussion stem largely from the specialtydriven structure of care, which is not optimal for generalized
chronic health problems (3, 4, 31, 34, 38, 42, 50, 51). Although
changes are occurring, including transformation of DOD
primary care clinics into patient-centered medical homes
and greater acceptance of complementary and alternative
medicine approaches, we are aware of only one trial of a collaborative stepped-care model in primary care (38). Another
critical gap involves treatment of substance use disorders,
which in the military has been handled as a nonmedical program with oversight by unit commanders. This program has
been excluded from federal privacy protections, linked with
occupational drug testing, and not managed under the medical system. This structure inhibits self-reporting of substance use disorders by soldiers who do not want their
commanders to be aware of their problems, and results in
treatment services that have been documented to lag well
behind civilian standards (49).
Another challenge concerns the dispersed nature of health
services for family members as well as reserve component
soldiers. Family members have borne the burden of long
separations, fear for the safety of deployed loved ones, tragic
losses, or caregiver fatigue. While many programs have been
established to address family needs, the reality is that families
experience added barriers, and less research has been conducted on the impact of these wars on families. Most family
member care is delivered through a network of off-post civilian providers willing to accept government insurance, and
it is less accessible than the direct care system. Reserve
component soldiers also face unique challenges, and there is
evidence that their rates of health concerns (both physical
and mental) are higher following deployment than for active
component soldiers (7, 19).
In addition to these challenges, these war years have
generated important unanswered questions that have implications for projecting future health care needs. First is a
lack of clarity on precisely why suicide rates rose so markedly
in Army and Marine Corps personnel but not in Air Force and
Navy personnel between 2006 and 2012, followed by a signiﬁcant downturn starting in 2013. Researchers have debated
potential causes, most critically whether or not combat deployments had direct associations (13–15, 57). Suicide rates
rose as sharply in nondeployers as in deployers, and the most
plausible explanation seems to be the unmitigated cumulative
operational strain of repeated training and deployment cycles
affecting all ground force personnel and a parallel rise in the

TABLE 3. Addressing Gaps in Mental Health Efforts for Service Members and Planning for Future Conﬂicts
Category
Ensure optimal clinical research infrastructure

Prioritize randomized clinical trials to ensure that
they meet the highest priority needs

Educate mental health providers

Evolve medical practice in-theater and in garrison

Address larger population needs

Validate prevention initiatives

Considerations and Recommendations
Sustain research funding for military-related mental health concerns
Ensure that research is incorporated into operational planning
Establish equitable processes for research grant applications that focus as much on
novel treatments/interventions as on established approaches
Foster grant applications from individual investigators. Establish research consortiums
only when multicenter trials are clearly indicated
Establish clear priorities that address most critical clinical gaps focused both on the
deployment mission and postdeployment care
Current top priorities include:
Interventions to improve treatment engagement and retention
Primary care interventions for postdeployment health conditions
Novel treatment approaches for PTSD and other mental health concerns
Incorporate lessons learned from recent wars into graduate medical education
programs
Maintain experienced military providers and educators who can ensure retention and
evolution of knowledge
Ensure that mental health clinicians are trained in and gain direct experience in
recognizing the immediate and long-term consequences of war and are skilled in
providing evidence-based treatment
Ensure that clinical practice guidelines and military doctrine and training incorporate
lessons from recent wars
Enhance ability to detect and understand long-term impact of mental disorders to
reﬁne screening, deployability criteria, and treatment
Ensure that screening efforts are partnered with care coordination
Ensure optimal structure of clinical services, both in-theater and postdeployment, and
continually re-evaluate the structure of care
Ensure continued synchronization and coordination of mental health care
Optimize care for generalized health concerns (e.g., collaborative primary care
interventions that address persistent postconcussion and/or postdeployment
symptoms, chronic pain, and polypharmacy)
Ensure availability of evidence-based treatments for substance use disorders, with
conﬁdentiality equivalent to that for other mental disorders
Sustain routine collection of clinically meaningful outcome measures
Address unique needs of reserve component members and ensure that they have
services equivalent to those of active component members
Ensure that the needs of families are fully addressed
Validate mental health prevention and/or resilience training prior to large-scale rollout
Build program evaluation into new programs and ensure that evaluations have

prevalence of underlying mental disorders over many war
years (14, 57).
Another important question concerns the efﬁcacy and
cost-effectiveness of reintegration, mental health prevention,
and resiliency training initiatives that the DOD made considerable investments in. A prime example is the Army’s
Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness initiative and its
associated resilience training, designed to reach all soldiers,
not just those experiencing psychological problems or seeking
care. Although criticized as not having adequate evidence (58),
this universal program was built on three components: the
Penn Resiliency Program (one of the most researched
resilience initiatives in civilian populations) (59), the Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research Battlemind program (the
only postdeployment training subjected to randomized trials)
(60, 61), and performance psychology research. The Army
made a landmark investment in unit-level randomized trials
to validate deployment and resilience educational interventions (60–64). These trials have demonstrated some efﬁcacy of
Am J Psychiatry 173:4, April 2016

the original postdeployment Battlemind training (60, 61), as
well as performance psychology components applied in a
basic training environment (62), and other resilience components not routinely provided to soldiers (63). Overall, however,
the randomized trial evidence shows, at best, small effect sizes
(60–64), and reports of effectiveness of the Comprehensive
Soldier and Family Fitness program as a whole are based on
program evaluations comparing units that do not appear to be
equivalent in type or operational deployment experiences
(65, 66).
SUMMARY
The U.S. Army has made a tremendous investment in research, transformed mental health services for soldiers and
families, and paved the way for DOD- and VA-wide efforts.
Given the size of the Army, the cumulative strain of 14 years of
war, continuing global threats, and persistent challenges with
underutilization of care, it is anticipated that the increased

TRANSFORMATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR U.S. SOLDIERS AND FAMILIES

need for mental health services will continue for years to
come. Among the most important distinctions between the
current and previous wars are the degree to which research
has guided programmatic changes and the willingness to
study these challenges to optimize clinical and public health
care strategies. Media coverage and congressional inquiries
have added to the attention on war-related mental health
problems. The Army Medical Command’s recognition of the
complexity of mental health problems, combined with increased
resources and continuous research investment to inform policies
and practices, has supported the transformation to a more
responsive, standardized, and evidence-based structuring of
mental health care, offering promise for improved outcomes
for soldiers and families. However, many challenges remain,
and it will be critical to ensure that persisting gaps are
addressed and knowledge gained during the current wars is
retained and further evolved. Table 3 summarizes considerations and recommendations for addressing ongoing gaps
and planning for future conﬂicts.
