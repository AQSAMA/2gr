Abstract
Background: Children and adolescents are more vulnerable to the affects of war and violence
than adults. At the time of initiation of this study, nothing was known about the prevalence of
childhood and early adolescence mental disorders. The aim of the present study is to measure the
point prevalence of mental disorders among children of 1–15 years age in the city of Mosul, Iraq.
Methods: A cross-sectional study design was adopted. Four primary health care centers were
chosen consecutively as a study setting. The subjects of the present study were mothers who came
to the primary health care center for vaccination of their children. The chosen mothers were
included by systematic sampling randomization. All children (aged 1–15) that each mother had were
considered in the interview and examination.
Results: Out of 3079 children assessed, 1152 have childhood mental disorders, giving a point
prevalence of 37.4%, with a male to female ratio of to 1.22:1. The top 10 disorders among the
examined children are post-traumatic stress disorder (10.5%), enuresis (6%), separation anxiety
disorder (4.3%), specific phobia (3.3%) stuttering and refusal to attend school (3.2% each), learning
and conduct disorders (2.5% each), stereotypic movement (2.3%) and feeding disorder in infancy
or early childhood (2.0%). Overall, the highest prevalence of mental disorders was among children
10–15 years old (49.2%) while the lowest was among 1–5 year olds (29.1%). Boys are more affected
than girls (40.2% and 33.2%, respectively).
Conclusion: Childhood mental disorders are a common condition highly prevalent amongst the
children and early adolescents in Mosul. Data from the present study mirrors the size of the
problem in local community. Several points deserve attention, the most important of which include
giving care at the community level, educating the public on mental health, involving communities
and families, monitoring community mental health indicators, and providing treatment at primary
health care level.

Background
In 1946 the World Health Organization (WHO) defined

health as a state of complete physical, mental and social
wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease or infirPage 1 of 8

mity. This definition provides a base for the broad perspective needed to analyze a population health [1].
Mental disorders are common, affecting more than 25%
of all people at some time during their lives. They are also
universal, affecting people of all countries and societies.
They have an economic impact on society and on the
quality of life of individuals and families. Mental disorders are present at any point in time in about 10% of the
adult population. It was estimated that, in 1990, mental
and neurological disorders accounted for 10% of the total
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to all diseases
and injuries. By 2000 this had risen to 12%, and by 2020
it is projected that the burden of these disorders will
increase to 15% [2]. Common disorders that usually cause
severe disabilities are: depression, substance abuse, schizophrenia, epilepsy, mental retardation (MR) and disorders of childhood and adolescence [3]. The overall
prevalence of mental and behavioral disorders among
children has been investigated in several studies from
developed and developing countries. Though the prevalence figures vary considerably among studies, it appears
that 10–20% of all children have one or more mental or
behavioral problems [2].
Mental and behavioral disorders of childhood and adolescence are very costly in both human and financial terms.
The aggregate disease burden of these disorders has not
been estimated, and it would be complex to calculate
because many of these disorders can be precursors to
much more disabling disorders during later life [2].
For more than two decades, the Iraqi nation as a whole
has been suffering from wars, sanctions and urban violence. The Iraqi children have been so greatly affected by
these dire conditions that we suspect they are facing very
real dangers of disease, starvation, psychological trauma
and death. A report released by a Canadian-led team of
health experts stated that the children in Iraq have a great
fear of war. Children as young as four described their clear
opinion about the horrors of war. They are afraid, anxious, and depressed about the prospect of war, the report
says. Many have nightmares, and only 40% think that life
is worth living [4]. These statements were documented in
2003. Before that time, other studies were carried out that
were mainly concerned with the effect of trauma on refugee children or in the post conflict areas in Kurdistan from
2000 onwards [5-7]. Many other studies investigated
mental disorders among adult refugees in USA and Netherlands [8,9].
At the time of initiation of this study, there were no available data to describe the situation of mental disorders
among children aged 1–15 years old in Mosul, one of the
largest cities in Iraq after the capital, Baghdad. Mosul is a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/7/274

highly populated city, where 39.8% of its population are
children aged 1–15 years old. In addition, it has a high
annual rate of growth that is similar to the overall rate of
growth in Iraq (2.9%). This warrants an active approach
to establish the overall point prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents aged 1–15 years old,
and to determine the rank order of each specific disorder.

Methods
Ethical agreement
Prior to data collection, official written permission was
obtained from the ethical and scientific committee of the
Directorate of Health (DOH) of Ninevah. Prior informed
consent from the mothers of all children in the studywas
orally obtained after an explanation of the aims and
objectives of the work.
Study setting
The study was conducted in Mosul city, the center of the
Ninevah governorate in the north of Iraq. For the purpose
of data collection, and because of poor security conditions
meaning it was impossible to carry out a household survey, a multistage sampling method was used. As Mosul is
situated on both sides of the River Tigris, two primary
health care centers (PHCCs) were consecutively chosen
from the official health sectors on each side. The chosen
centers have wide catchments areas and they serve a population whose size varies between 32676–60390 with differing socio-economic stratas.
Study participants
According to the national strategy of the Iraqi Ministry of
Health, all children present in the catchment areas of
PHCCs should receive vaccination at those centers. All the
mothers (n = 843) included in the study by systematic
sampling randomization (where every third woman was
accepted) were informed about the study and requested
by the interviewer to bring their children aged between 1–
15 (if they had any) to the center on a fixed date.

Figure 1 illustrates the sample size determination in the
present study. The median number of mothers attending
each primary health care center (PHCC) per month was
considered as a background. Then, 40% of this number
was taken, which yielded 3231 children aged between 1–
15 years old. Non-participants included refusals to participate, no-shows and non-eligible children. Thus, the final
sample included 3079 children. No information was collected about the non-participants.
Data collection
Data collection was performed by one interviewer using a
standardized questionnaire form. The items on this form
included the diagnostic criteria taken from DSM-IVTR2000 [10]. Refusal to attend school was diagnosed

according to the criteria mentioned in DSM-III-1980 [11].
The intent of the investigators was to classify refusal to
attend school into intentional and obligatory. The
designed form was reviewed by a scientific committee
consisting of six experts, two from the fields of psychiatry,
three from community medicine and one from health statistics. During the pilot study, this questionnaire was
shown to have a high reliability (83.5%) and validity
(89.6%).

The respondent mother and her child or children were
interviewed in a special room in the PHCC. The interviewer inquired about the socio-demographic characteristics of the family, the child's developmental history, past
medical history, history of mental disorders among the
family, the child's toys, interest and hobbies. In addition,
a child interview was performed with children greater
than 7 years old. With children aged 1–7 years old, a simple interview was conducted according to the age. Any
child who had any impairment or delay in development

of specific functions such as speech or language, or overall
pervasive development, or any disturbance in behavior or
emotion was considered as a case of mental disorder and
hence included in the mental disorder group.
Data collection was conducted over the eight-month
period from 1 September 2003 to 30 April 2004. Data
entry and statistical analysis was carried out using the
SPSS package. The prevalence objective of this study was
analyzed as the proportion of children who have mental
disorders out of the total surveyed population, by age
group and sex.
Chi-square and Z-tests were used to find statistical association or difference. For the presence or absence of significance, a p-value < 0.05 was considered to be significant
throughout the study analysis.

Results
During the eight-month period of data collection, 843
mothers were interviewed. This figure yielded a total of
3231 children aged 1–15 years old. Of this number, 3079
children were included in the study.

Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of
study population. Over a quarter (26.9%) of the children
were 1–4 years old, 44.4% were 5–9 years old and 28.7%
were 10–15 years old. The male to female ratio was
1.22:1. Housewives formed 95.8% of the total mothers
approached; 92.3% of fathers were employed (either selfemployed, civil servants or in the private sector). A total of
67.4% of mothers were either illiterate or had only a primary certificate of education, whereas 23.2% of fathers
were university graduates.
At the time of the survey there were 1152 diseased children in the study population. The overall point prevalence
of mental disorders among the study sample was 37.4%.
The top 10 disorders found were: post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD; 10.5%), enuresis (6.0%), separation anxiety disorder (4.3%) and specific phobia (3.3%). Stuttering and refusal to attend school each had a point
prevalence of 3.2%. The point prevalence of learning disorders (LD) was 2.5%, and the same figure was reported
for conduct disorder (CD). Stereotypic movement had a
prevalence of (2.3%), and feeding disorder of infancy or
early childhood (2.0%).
Gender and type specific point prevalence stratification is
shown in Table 2. Overall, mental disorders were significantly more common among boys than girls (40.9% and
33.2%, respectively; p < 0.001). However, PTSD showed a
reverse trend, where girls had a significantly higher point
prevalence than boys (13.8% versus 7.8%; p < 0.001).
Specific phobia showed the same trend (4.9% versus
2.1%) as did rumination (0.7% versus 0.4%). Enuresis is
significantly more common among boys (p = 0.008).
Similarly, stuttering (p < 0.001), conduct disorders (p <
0.001) and feeding disorders of infancy or early childhood (p = 0.011) were more common in boys.
Table 3 depicts the age specific point prevalence of childhood and early adolescence mental disorders among the
study sample. Overall, the highest prevalence was among
children 10–15 year old (49.2%), followed by those 5–9
years old (34.9%). The lowest figure was among those 1–
4 years old (29.1%). This variation is of highly significant
value (p < 0.001). Considering the older age group, separation anxiety disorder and PTSD were at the top of the list
(11.2% and 11.0%) respectively, while for the age range
5–9, PTSD and enuresis had the highest values (9.7% and
8.9%, respectively). PTSD remains the disease of highest
prevalence in the 1–4 year old age group (11.1%), followed by reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early
childhood (6.5%).
Table 4 demonstrates the patterns of comorbidity among
the study sample. Out of the total number of children
examined, 62.1% have a solitary disorder, 29.9% have

two disorders and only 8.0% have more than two. In reference to PTSD, which was the commonest, we found out
that among the 127 cases that had two disorders, 24.4%
were associated with enuresis, 11.0% with stuttering,
10.2% with refusal to attend school and 9.4% with
depression. Other comorbidities showed inconspicuous
trends.

Discussion
Contrary to popular belief, mental disorders are common
during childhood and adolescence. Inadequate attention
is paid to this area of mental health [2]. In a recent report,
the Surgeon General of the United States has said that the
United States is facing a public crisis in the mental health
of infants, children and adolescents [12]. According to

this report, 1 in 10 young people suffers from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of impairment, yet
fewer than 1 in 5 receives the necessary treatment [12].

For more than two decades, Iraq has faced many wars and
sanctions that have affected all aspects of life, particularly
the health status of children and women of childbearing
age who are at grave risk of malnutrition, disease, death
and mental disorders. Therefore, the point prevalence of
childhood and early adolescence mental disorders
reported in this study (37.4%) could be an important
indicator of the impact of the problem on children in
Mosul. If this figure is applied to all children in the population aged 1–15 in Mosul city (n = 180465), this means
that at the time of the survey there were 67674 cases of
mental disorders amongst this group. In 2007, this figure
will probably be much higher. A higher figure was
reported in a study carried out on the epidemiology of
behavioral and emotional problems among Palestinian
children. This study enrolled 959 children from Gaza
strip. The results showed that the case incidence was
54.4% in boys and 46.5% girls [13]. The same gender difference has been found in the present study, where the
overall prevalence is 40.9% in boys and 33.2% in girls (p
< 0.001). Child mental disorder diagnoses vary all over
the world; therefore, any diagnosis should take into consideration the culture and the environment where a child
is raised, because what is considered normal in one society is considered abnormal in the other. Mental health of
children and adolescents is influenced by displacement
through wars, catastrophe, by stresses on the family and
by economic adversities. The lives of many children who
face uncertain futures, including those who are traumatized by wars and disasters, are afflicted by the burden of
serious emotional and behavioral disorders [2].
Post-traumatic stress disorder arises after stressful events
of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature.
The point prevalence of PTSD in the general population,
according to the Global Burden of Disease for the year
2000 (GBD2000), is 0.37% [2]. Although the events that
cause PTSD are common, there are no epidemiological
studies that specifically study PTSD in young persons. It is
quite clear, however, that this disorder is more common
in young people exposed to life-threatening events [14].
In this study, PTSD is at the top of the list of mental disorders affecting the study sample, where just over 1 in every
10 youths (10.5%) have PTSD. In January to March 2006,
three studies on the prevalence of mental disorders
among children were performed in Baghdad, Mosul and
Dohuk. In Baghdad, 14% of the examined children had
PTSD. In Mosul, a very much higher figure was found
where 30% of studied subjects had symptoms of PTSD
[15]. Previously, a 26 month follow up of PTSD in children after a mass escape in Kurdistan in the north of Iraq
showed that 20% of the children aged 5–16 fulfilled the

criteria of PTSD at the baseline test. Twenty-six months
later 18% were re-identified [5]. Regarding the implications of elevated PTSD for later adult outcomes of afflicted
youth, Garbarino and Kostelny [16] in their study of Palestinian mothers and children found that children
exposed to the full range of war-related risks generally
were well adjusted if they faced these risks in the context
of a functional and supportive family system; this is very
common among Iraqi families. However, if these children
experienced family problems as well as war risk, they
would likely suffer more serious psychological distress
[16].
The specific diagnosis of PTSD has been questioned as
being culture-specific and also being overdiagnosed.
Indeed, PTSD has been called a diagnostic category that
has been invested based on socio-political needs [17].
However, a comparative study between refugee children
in Sweden and Swedish children of the same age, sex, and
trauma score showed no significant difference in the PTSD
diagnosis [6]. In PTSD, it has been reported that girls
always have higher symptom scores than boys. This statement supports the finding of the present study, where girls
reported a significantly higher prevalence than boys
(13.8% versus 7.8%; p < 0.001). Assessment of 1090 adolescents carried out in Mosul in 2006 showed the same
gender difference; however, the reported figures were
higher (32% for girls versus 26% for boys) [15]. Age range
difference is likely to be responsible for this variation
between the results, or it is possible the mothers have significantly underestimated both the intensity and duration
of the stress reaction in the present study sample.
The second most common mental disorder found among
study sample was enuresis, which had an overall point
prevalence of 6.0%. Boys reported significantly higher figures than girls (7.1% versus 4.8%) (p < 0.001). The highest prevalence was among 5–9 year olds (8.9%), then 10–
15 year olds (7.4%), with a difference of highly significant
value (p < 0.001). Mikkelsen [18] cited lower figures,
which were 6.7% for boys 7 years of age who were bedwetting at least once a week or more, compared to only 0.5%
for girls. Unfortunately, in this study the investigators did
not enquire about the frequency of bedwetting.
The present study shows that separation anxiety ranks
third among the list of disorders afflicting the examined
children, with a point prevalence of 4.3%. Girls reported
a slightly higher figure than boys (4.5% and 4.2%, respectively). The point prevalence of this disorder significantly
rises from 0.8% in 1–4 year old children to 2.0% in 5–9
year olds and 11.2% in 10–15 year olds (p < 0.001). Costello et al [19] examined the prevalence of separation anxiety disorder in children aged 9–13 years old in the Great
Smoky Mountains study (5.7 ± 1%). Subsequently, Syl-

vester [20] suggested that children with this disorder are
more likely to come from low socio-economic backgrounds and single parent homes. The same suggestion
can be applied to the present study, where there is a combination of low socio-economic status with the burden of
sanctions, war and daily violence that afflict the majority
of Iraqis, particularly children. Such an unusual situation
may also lead to an increase in the prevalence of specific
phobia (3.3%). An evidently lower figure was reported
among American children aged 8, 12 and 17 years old;
only 1% of them met the criteria for this disorder [21]. In
the present study, the gender distribution of specific phobia is significantly in favor of girls (p < 0.001), and it has
a significantly higher rate in the aged 5–9 group (5.0%),
improving when the child becomes older (4.0%) (p <
0.001).
Refusal to attend school shows a significantly high prevalence among 10–15 year old children (7.2%; p < 0.001),
and a higher rate is reported for boys than girls (3.5% and
2.8%, respectively). Although this gender difference is of
no significant value, it is worth noting that this trend is the
result of poverty among families where many children at
the age of 10–15 tend to leave school. Boys help their
fathers to increase the family income, while girls keep
house and nurse babies in the absence of their working
mothers.
Other less common disorders show either an increase
among children aged 1–4 years old, or start to appear at
this age and become very evident among 10–15 year olds.
For all these disorders, boys are more affected than girls
except for depression and rumination disorders.
Methodology issues
There are certain points relevant to this study that merit
discussion. This study is cross-sectional in design. Because
of the poor security conditions in Mosul, the study sample
was based at the PHCC that serves as the primary care provider. This may not represent the whole population.
Accounting for failure to show, refusals to participate and
ineligibility, the estimated participation rate is approximately 95.4%. Unfortunately, no information was collected about non-participants. In the present work, the
study unit was mothers who attended the PHCC for vaccination of their children. This was chosen for two reasons:
the first was to overcome the bias of sampling based on
PHCC, as all the children present in the catchment area of
the PHCC are to have their vaccination there and mothers
are responsible for bringing them to the PHCC. Therefore,
mothers were asked by the interviewer to bring their other
children aged 1–15 to the center. The second reason was
to ensure ease of interviewing the children aged 1–7 years
old at the PHCC, as at this age the interview needs to take
place in a location the child is comfortable in. The well-

designed questionnaire, which was introduced by a welltrained interviewer in a friendly atmosphere, might have
reduced this bias.
In the present study, the specific mental disorders were
diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR 2000 criteria [10]. In
Mosul city there are no facilities to diagnose different
grades of mental retardation, types of learning disorder
and communication disorders; thus, the diagnoses was
made as a specific disorder only (i.e., the further specification of these three categories was not carried out).

Conclusion
The present study concludes that childhood and early
adolescence mental disorders are common conditions
afflicting children and early adolescents in Mosul. Several
points are important for consideration: the giving of care
at a community level; public education on mental health,
involving families and communities in decision-making
on policies, programs and services; and the inclusion of
mental health indicators in the health records of the Ministry of Health. Lastly, provision of care and treatment at
the primary health care level is urgently needed.
