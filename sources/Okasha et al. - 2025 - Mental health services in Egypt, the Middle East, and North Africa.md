ABSTRACT

This review provides insight into the contemporary challenges and initiatives in mental health
care across Egypt, the Middle East, and North Africa (MENA) region. It examines the structural
barriers, including fragmented public health systems and inadequate resource allocation, which
hinder access to mental health services. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges,
prompting innovative approaches like telepsychiatry and the establishment of specialized
psychiatric hospitals. Despite advancements in psychiatric education and research, disparities
persist, particularly in rural mental health care. Limited funding, workforce shortages, and barriers
to accessing medications and post-hospitalization support further compound the issue.
International and local efforts aim to address these challenges, with a focus on enhancing child
and adolescent mental health services and supporting populations affected by the refugee crisis.
Policy reforms, increased financial allocation, and workforce development are essential for
overcoming these obstacles and ensuring equitable access to quality mental health care
throughout the MENA region. This review underscores the urgent need for collaborative action to
improve mental health outcomes and reduce disparities in the region.

Introduction
Arab countries, encompassing the Arab League
nations in Africa and Asia, have a population of 420–
450 million, approximately 34 million immigrants,
significant numbers of refugees, and internally displaced persons (United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees, 2023; World Bank, 2022). With over 100
million people, Egypt is the most populous. Around
38% of Arabs are under 14 years old, while approximately 12 million people, constituting 15% of the
labor force, are unemployed. Despite improvements,
adult illiteracy rates remain high, with 65 million
adults, predominantly women, lacking literacy skills
(Okasha et al., 2012).
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region
faces significant mental health challenges exacerbated
by war, geopolitical instability, and natural disasters
(Ben-Zeev et al., 2024). These challenges compound
existing issues such as stigma, low awareness, limited
institutional and funding resources, inadequate publishing opportunities, insufficient research training,
and a shortage of reliable assessment tools.

While the prevalence of mental health conditions
in the MENA region has remained relatively stable
over the past two decades, they represent a growing
share of the total disease burden. In countries like
Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar, mental health conditions constitute over double the global average of
5% of the total disease burden. The region’s young
population and high burden of non-communicable
diseases pose further risks for exacerbating the burden of mental illness (Dattani et al., 2023).

History, culture, and social factors that impact
mental health in Egypt, Middle East, and
North Africa
Mental health awareness in Egypt, the Middle East,
and Northern Africa (MENA) dates back centuries, as
evidenced by an ancient Egyptian papyrus from the
Pharaonic period, which documented mental illness,
attributing causes to mystical theories but treated
somatically (Okasha, 2004). Establishing the first
Islamic mental hospital in Baghdad around 705
AD marked a significant advancement in mental

healthcare, with subsequent hospitals in Cairo,
Damascus, and Aleppo (Sadik & Al-Jadiry, 2006).
By the ninth century, the Arab world had developed diagnostic and treatment practices for mental
health issues, including identifying eating disorders
like anorexia nervosa and documenting depressive illness, in works such as Ishaq Ibn Imran’s ‘Maqaal ‘ala
malaakhoolia’ (Omrani et al., 2012). Islamic scholars
like Al-Balkhi and Rhazes contributed to the description of psychotherapy, with Rhazes overseeing a psychiatric ward in a Baghdad hospital and introducing
innovative treatments such as moral treatment and
music therapy (Paladin, 1998).
In the 10th century, Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi
emphasized the interplay between mind and body in
psychosomatic diseases in his book ‘Sustenance for
Body and Soul’. Avicenna’s ‘Qanun fi-l-Tibb,’ completed in 1025, remains a renowned medical encyclopedia, dedicating three chapters to neuropsychiatric
disorders and expanding the theory of temperaments
to include mentality and emotions (Zahoor &
Haq, 1997).
The 14th century saw the emergence of the first
psychiatric unit at Kalaoon Hospital in Cairo, featuring a community-focused treatment approach, foreshadowing modern trends in mental healthcare
(Okasha, 2016). This historical progression highlights
the rich heritage of mental health understanding and
treatment in the MENA region, centuries ahead of
similar European developments.
At the onset of the British protectorate in Egypt,
asylum care was introduced, leading to the closure of
the Department of Mental Health at Cairo University’s
Medical School in 1880, redirecting psychiatrists
towards newly constructed asylums with vocational
training (Loza & Nawawi, 2012). Egypt took a significant legislative step in mental health in 1944, gaining
parliamentary approval ahead of many Arab and
African nations.
Culture plays a pivotal role in diagnosing and
treating mental health issues, with Ibn Khaldoun
being the first to describe the relationship between
mental health and culture in the Islamic world
(Okasha, 1999). Arab and Islamic cultures prioritize
collective community values over individual autonomy, with the family as the central unit of society,
influencing decision-making and support structures.
In these societies, the doctor-patient interaction is
highly valued, often surpassing technical abilities, and
respecting cultural and spiritual norms is paramount
(Okasha & Okasha, 2021).
In Arab culture, physical symptoms often serve as the
primary indicator of illness, with psychological distress

307

sometimes dismissed or stigmatized (Okasha, 2000).
Patients and families may exaggerate verbal reports of
distress, reflecting the language’s emotional nature and
complicating access to mental health services.
Traditional healers (THs) play a significant role in
mental health support, offering religious-based interventions where formal healthcare access is limited
(Okasha et al., 2012). In Egypt and other Arab countries, a substantial portion of individuals with mental
disorders initially seek advice from THs before turning to formal healthcare (Assad et al., 2015).
Traditional healing often involves rituals to exorcise
spirits believed to cause mental illness, aligning with
cultural beliefs in possession and supernatural causes.
This parallel belief system coexists with conventional
medicine, particularly in rural areas with scarce psychiatric facilities (Pradhan et al., 2014).
In Arab culture, the avoidance of seeking professional help due to perceived weakness, coupled with a
lack of awareness about available mental health services and the stigma associated with seeking psychological help, impacts help-seeking behavior (Sayed,
2015). Despite the availability of mental health services in affluent areas like the UAE, reluctance to seek
help from mental health professionals persists due to
stigma, leading many to seek assistance from religious
figures instead (Sayed, 2015; Thomas et al., 2015).
Mental illnesses may be perceived as a sign of weakness in faith, prompting individuals to seek solace
through spiritual practices like prayer and Qur’an
readings (Thomas et al., 2015).
The focus on psychopathology themes over specific
diagnoses can lead individuals to turn to THs for
symptoms with religious connotations, causing delays
in accessing formal mental health services and affecting long-term outcomes (Assad et al., 2015), as well
as non-adherence to medications after discharge from
hospitals (Abdel Aziz et al., 2016). Some countries,
like Jordan and Saudi Arabia, have explored integrating the roles of religious and traditional healers into
formal medical care. In Jordan, healers and mental
health professionals have established an informal relationship to support patients. In Saudi Arabia, mental
healthcare provision incorporates religious texts and
recitations (Okasha et al., 2012).
While some studies support the value of traditional
healing, many Muslims do not consider it Islamic,
raising questions about its appropriateness and legality
in certain Muslim countries. Despite the availability
of conventional medical care, individuals may still
turn to THs, highlighting the influence of social and
cultural factors in their decision-making (Green &
Colucci, 2020).

T. OKASHA ET AL.

Religion and cultural norms significantly shape the
clinical presentation of psychiatric conditions in
Egypt, with religious delusions being common due to
the country’s high religiosity (Okasha, 2004). These
delusions often reflect a societal emphasis on religious
themes alongside political and social ones, while
autistic delusions are less prevalent. Religious delusions are more frequent among Muslims and
Christians, reflecting the religious nature of upbringing and education in Egypt (Okasha, 2016).
Cultural values and morals play a crucial role in
help-seeking behaviors for psychiatric disorders in
Egypt, with religious rituals and phrases serving as
coping mechanisms for blasphemous thoughts (Okasha
& Okasha, 2000, 2021). Despite representing a
minority, Christians in Egypt exhibit similar presenting symptoms to Muslims, with religious and sexual
thoughts being predominant in obsessions (Okasha &
Okasha, 2000).

Mental health services in Egypt and the
MENA region
The necessity for the provision of mental health services is reinforced by the 13.1% prevalence of any
psychiatric disorder in the adult and elderly population. Within this, major depressive disorder presents
as the most common diagnosis (6.78%), followed by
anxiety disorders (4.96%) and obsessive-compulsive
disorder (2.32%). Substance use was found to be
7.1%, and substance use disorder was 5.4%. Among
children and adolescents, the prevalence of any psychiatric disorder was 14.9%, where attention deficit
hyperactive disorder was the most common (6.83%),
followed by oppositional defiant disorder (3.05%)
(World Health Organization, 2021). The frequency
and diversity of these presentations highlight the need
for continued improvement in the services offered to
the population.
Until 2000, there was a considerable treatment gap
in mental health services in Egypt, with an average of
less than one bed per 12,000 of the population, falling
far below WHO recommendations (Ghanem et al.,
2009). Mental hospitals were mainly concentrated in
Cairo and Alexandria, lacking integration into primary care and leading to inadequate prevention, early
detection, and management (Elnemais Fawzy, 2017).
In 2001, the Minister of Health and Population initiated an Egyptian-Finnish bilateral comprehensive
reform program, followed by a thorough appraisal
of mental health services in 2007, aiming for better
integration, coordination, supervision, and training

(Jenkins et al., 2010). This led to the development of
the Mental Health Act in 2009 (Act No. 71 of 2009),
resulting in increased investments, awareness campaigns, and national programs combatting stigma and
discrimination against individuals with mental health
conditions (Elnemais Fawzy, 2017).
These changes in Egypt have mirrored significant
transformations in the broader Arab region, particularly in psychiatric services. Large mental hospitals
are gradually being replaced by psychiatric units
within general hospitals, with some countries further
decentralizing psychiatric services to district hospitals and smaller peripheral units (World Health
Organization, 2006).
For instance, in Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of
Health provides primary mental health services,
supported by other government agencies providing
psychiatric treatment for state employees, with a
mental health law passed in 2014 (Carlisle, 2018).
Mental health services have slowly developed in
Oman, with a limited number of psychiatrists and
nurses working in mental health facilities before
2014 (Al-Sinawi & Mirza, 2023). Bahrain offers free
psychiatric consultation services under the Ministry
of Health’s jurisdiction (Grey et al., 2015), while
Qatar launched a National Mental Health Strategy
in 2013, transitioning towards community-based
care (Wadoo et al., 2021). Kuwait’s mental health
counseling and therapy are still in a developmental
stage (Al-Qimlass, 2015).
Structure
Egypt’s Ministry of Health (MoH) oversees mental
health services through two main systems. The Mental
Health Secretariat (MHS), led by the General Secretary
of Mental Health (GSMH), supervises 18 mental hospitals and centers across 13 governorates, including a
community mental health center in Kafr El Dawar,
Behara. Services include general adult psychiatry,
addiction treatment (with a focus on gender-specific
care for female addicts and adolescents), child and
adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, rehabilitation, and community psychiatry (General Secretariat
of Mental Health and Addiction Treatment, 2012).
The second system comprises 13 mental health
departments within the General and Central Hospitals
of the MoHP. These departments receive MHS support and are overseen by NGOs and outpatient clinics. Additionally, there are psychiatric departments
n public medical schools and military hospitals
(Elnemais Fawzy, 2017).

International Review of Psychiatry

As of 2013, Egypt had 61 licensed mental health
facilities (17 governmental, 44 private) with a total
bed capacity of 7921 beds (1966 private, 5955 public)
(General Secretariat of Mental Health and Addiction
Treatment, 2013).
Facilities
Egypt’s public health system is divided among different bodies like the Ministry of Health and Population
(MoHP), Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), and
Health Insurance Organization (HIO). MoHP is the
main healthcare provider, running about 5000 facilities with over 80,000 beds nationwide. It delivers services across various geographic, structural, functional,
and programmatic dimensions. MoHP also dominates
inpatient care, with around 1048 facilities and 80,000
beds, while the private sector contributes 2024 facilities, covering 16% of total inpatient bed capacity
(El-Zanaty & Way, 2006).
Workforce
In Egypt, 3836 individuals, including 2790 nurses, 117
psychologists, and 224 social workers, act as mental
health providers in mental health facilities (Saeed, 2018).
Egypt has approximately 1100 registered psychiatrists,
with 889 working within GSMHAT facilities (Okasha
et al., 2022). Within GSMHAT’s facilities, there are 5259
in inpatient facilities and 608 in outpatient facilities.
The ratios of mental health workers per 100,000
population in Egypt indicate a significant deficiency
compared to WHO standards for low-income countries. For instance, the ratios are 0.12 psychologists,
0.68 psychiatrists, 3.1 nurses, 0.29 social workers, and
7.3 total mental health workers per 100,000 population, falling short of WHO standards (World Health
Organization, 2015).
Across the MENA region, there is a notable shortage of doctors and nurses, with the region experiencing one of the highest disease burdens globally (Crisp
& Chen, 2014). Disparities exist among countries,
with Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait having the highest
number of psychiatrists but still facing shortages.
Conversely, seven countries, including Iraq, Libya,
Morocco, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, have
fewer than 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000 population.
While there have been increases in nurses, psychologists, and social workers compared to previous surveys, some countries like Djibouti lack psychiatrists,
relying on general practitioners with a special interest
in mental health (Okasha et al., 2012).

Legislation and policy
In Egypt, the Mental Health Act of 2009 replaced the
previous legislation and focused on safeguarding the
human rights of patients in psychiatric facilities. It
addressed various aspects of mental health services,
including the role of Mental Health Councils, patient
admission, treatment and rights, Mental Health Fund,
and penalties for staff and institutions (General
Secretariat of Mental Health & Addiction Treatment,
2013). This legislation aimed to establish legal frameworks, combat stigma, raise public awareness, and
protect patient rights (Elnemais Fawzy, 2017). To
combat stigma, the term Brain Synchronization
Therapy (BST) was introduced to replace
Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), aiming to change
the wrong perceptions and attitudes to the therapy of
both families, patients and community (Okasha &
Okasha, 2014).
However, in 2011, the Code of Practice of the
Mental Health Act was revised, allowing compulsory
psychotropic medication use and involuntary use of
Brain Synchronization Therapy (BST) without a second opinion for initial sessions (Loza & Nawawi,
2012). Also, legislation protecting the rights of people
with disabilities, including the mentally ill, aiming for
access to healthcare facilities and integration of children with special needs in schools and universities
and rehabilitation services and employment opportunities (Okasha & Shaker, 2024).
Across the region, most countries have developed
mental health policies, substance use policies, programs, and legislation between 2014 and 2020, indicating a significant advancement in acknowledging
and addressing mental health as a fundamental right.
Notably, Mauritania and Comoros lack mental health
policies, while Lebanon and Somalia lack mental
health legislation (World Health Organization, 2021).
The inadequate monitoring of mental health legislation and policies in healthcare settings has contributed to the increased stigma surrounding mental
health. Healthcare professionals’ lack of awareness of
patients’ rights is partly attributed to the poor enforcement of mental health policies.

Mental health services
Primary care
Egypt’s primary care system comprises two tiers:
Family Health Units (FHUs) and Family Health
Centers (FHCs). In 2017, Egypt had 5391 primary
care units distributed based on population density.

310

T. OKASHA ET AL.

Each unit typically includes a family physician, an
internal medicine specialist, a surgical specialist,
and six nurses and social workers. However, there
was a shortfall in the number of physicians assigned,
with only 9022 out of the targeted 16,000
(Saeed, 2018).
Mental health services are integrated into primary
care under the General Secretariat of Mental Health
and Addiction Treatment (GSMHAT). In FHUs, primary care physicians assess patients and refer them to
FHCs if necessary. FHCs host outpatient clinics run
by a psychiatrist from the local mental hospital twice
a week. The psychiatrist collaborates with general
practitioners on challenging cases. Although FHCs
ideally oversee the population of the catchment area
and FHUs, this responsibility is not formally specified
(Jenkins et al., 2010).

The public sector accounts for 60% of these services, while the public health sector provides 40%.
The mental health workforce in this field includes
pediatricians (50%), general psychiatrists (20%), child
and adolescent psychiatrists (7%), non-professionals
(20%), and primary care physicians (3%). Educational
services are provided primarily by national government schools (70%), with the private sector (20%)
and public sector (5%) also contributing (World
Health Organization, 2017). Despite these efforts,
Egypt faces the alarming fact that 40% of its population is under the age of 18, and 15–20% of these children and adolescents need mental health services.
Unfortunately, only 5% of them receive the necessary
care (Central Agency for Public Mobilization and
Statistic, 2008).
Rehabiltation and day centers

Specialized care
Within the GSMHAT hospitals in Egypt, 15 out of 18
provide addiction treatment services, including outpatient, inpatient, and daycare units, with 563 beds.
Abbasia Hospital, a large centralized mental health
facility, primarily handles public inpatient addiction
treatment services. Forensic psychiatry services are
mainly concentrated in Al Khanka and Al Abbassia
hospitals, with ten wards dedicated to this purpose.
As of 2016, these units operated with 594–613 beds,
maintaining occupancy rates ranging from 90% to
100% (Saeed, 2018).

Rehabilitation interventions include day care centers
and programs at four GSMHAT facilities: El Matar
Hospital, Abbassia Hospital, El-Maamoura Hospital,
and El Khanka Hospital, specifically for patients with
addiction problems. The rehabilitation programs
encompass psychiatric education, life skills development for high-risk situations, motivation enhancement, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family
therapy, family consultation, and relapse prevention
techniques (Saeed, 2018). Additionally, the programs
offer art therapy and behavior modification for children, adolescents, (El Gabry et al., 2021) and general
adult Psychiatry Patients.

Child and adolescent psychiatry services
The first child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient
clinic in Egypt was established in 1982 at the Institute
of Psychiatry, Ain Shams University Hospitals. Initially,
the clinic operated twice a week, but after six months,
it expanded to four days a week, and it now runs six
days a week. Egypt not only has the highest number
of academic Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP)
departments in the region but is also one of only five
Middle Eastern countries with a national CAP society.
Approximately 30% of Egyptian psychiatrists receive
six months of specialized training in Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry (El Gabry et al., 2021). Child
and adolescent psychiatry services in Egypt are
well-structured, with referrals coming from primary
care services, other specialties, or through self-referral
at walk-in clinics. These services are offered in governmental and university hospitals, as well as some
public facilities.

Telemedicine and mental health services in Egypt
during the COVID-19 pandemic
By early April 2020, Egypt had reported nearly 800
COVID-19 cases, which surged to 6,465 within a
month, leading to 430 deaths (Ministry of Health and
Population, 2020). This rapid increase, combined with
limited knowledge about the virus and overwhelming
media coverage, caused significant anxiety and fear
among the population (Bao et al., 2020). The strict
health measures implemented to control the spread of
the virus also contributed to social stigma and psychological distress (Brooks et al., 2020). Research
indicated that 67.1% of the population experienced
depression, along with elevated levels of anxiety and
stress (Arafa et al., 2021). Among healthcare workers,
the infection and mortality rates were particularly
concerning, with a high rate of 16% and notable
mental health issues, especially among female and

International Review of Psychiatry

younger staff members (Abdelghani et al., 2020;
Khalaf et al., 2020).
Ain Shams University hospitals in Egypt led the
way in Africa and the Middle East by implementing
telemedicine services long before COVID-19, and
during the pandemic, they expanded these services
significantly. The Okasha Institute of Psychiatry at the
University’s Hospital introduced a flexible and adaptable telepsychiatry plan using smartphones and
WhatsApp to provide psychiatric consultations, especially in inpatient wards. This approach helped comply with strict infection control measures, particularly
in quarantine hospitals with the evolution of psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
Early in the pandemic, the GSMHAT initiated an
action plan for mental health with support from the
WHO. This plan addressed Mental Health Psychosocial
Support (MHPSS) for all individuals in Egypt. Five
task force groups were established to respond rapidly
and cohesively to various priority areas, including
community support, medical staff assistance, specialized psychological support, psychiatric patient care,
and media communication. Additionally, GSMHAT
expanded hotline services in April 2020 to provide
round-the-clock psychological support to all segments
of society. A team of psychiatrists from GSMHAT
hospitals was recruited to provide follow-up care for
cases requiring psychological support or exhibiting
psychiatric symptoms in 15 quarantine hospitals
across Egypt.
During the acute phase of the pandemic, strict
infection control policies implemented by the Egyptian
Ministry of Health, under the supervision of the
World Health Organization, led to significant restrictions on inpatient admissions in governmental psychiatric hospitals across Egypt (Youssef et al., 2020).
However, in June 2020, Egypt responded by establishing the Al Fatimia Cairo Hospital, a specialized facility dedicated to the acute admission of psychiatric
patients affected by COVID-19 during the lockdown
phase. This hospital is the only one of its kind in the
Middle East, dedicated solely to providing mental
health services for these patients. These initiatives
exemplify Egypt’s proactive approach to addressing
mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, setting a remarkable example for both Africa
and the Middle East (Okasha et al., 2022).

Psychiatric education and research
Okasha and Shaker assessed psychiatric training programs across Arab countries, revealing that all

311

participating Arab countries offer undergraduate programs for medical students, varying in duration from
3 to 30 weeks (Okasha & Shaker, 2020). Common
teaching methods include lectures, case presentations,
self-learning, case scenarios, and role-play. However,
clinical training is reported in only 30% of countries.
Assessment methods predominantly include MCQ
and OSCE exams.
Regarding psychiatry residency training, durations
typically span 3–5 years, with 60% of countries offering 4-year programs. Specialized training programs
are present in 50% of countries, with child and adolescent psychiatry programs being the most common,
followed by addiction and cognitive behavioral psychotherapy programs. Qatar is the sole country offering a geriatric program. Sub-specialty fellowship or
master’s programs are available in five countries, with
average training lasting 1–2 years. Overall, progress
has been made in undergraduate psychiatric education across the Arab world in the past decade, with
psychiatric education now included in many medical
school curricula.
Despite the prevalence of mental disorders in the
Arab region, mental health publications from this
area accounted for only 1% of global contributions
from 2009 to 2018. However, there has been a notable
increase, with the number of articles rising from 279
to 728 across 22 countries, reflecting a growth of
160% compared to 57% globally. Concurrently, there
has been an improvement in publication quality, with
a higher proportion of articles published in top-quartile
journals. The United Arab Emirates has experienced a
significant surge in publications, contributing 7% of
all regional publications. Noteworthy institutions leading in publication output are predominantly situated
in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon. Among them,
Cairo University, Ain Shams University, King
Abdulaziz University, King Saud University, American
University of Beirut, University of Balamand Group,
and Saint Joseph University are prolific contributors
(Maalouf et al., 2019).

Gaps and challenges
Despite improvements in Egypt’s mental health
resources, challenges persist due to structural issues,
such as the National Mental Health Council chaired
by the Minister of Health, posing potential conflicts
of interest (Elnemais Fawzy, 2017). Fragmentation
within the public health system, involving various
organizations like MoHP, MoHE, and HIO, leads to
disjointed policies and services (Jenkins et al., 2010;

312

T. OKASHA ET AL.

World Bank, 2015), relying heavily on institutional
medicalization, neglecting community-based care and
post-hospitalization support. Challenges in accessing
medications upon discharge exacerbate continuity of
care issues (Jenkins et al., 2010; World Bank, 2015).
Similar barriers to mental health services access are
observed across Arab countries, including Egypt,
characterized by long waiting times, service availability, transportation costs, and financial constraints
(Khatib et al., 2023). In Egypt, government expenditure on mental health constitutes approximately 2% of
total health expenditure, with a significant portion,
about 59%, directed towards large centralized mental
health hospitals (General Secretariat of Mental Health
& Addiction Treatment, 2012; Jenkins et al., 2010).
This disproportionate allocation underscores disparities in coverage and access to mental health services,
stemming from inadequate resource allocation within
the sector.
Within GSMH facilities, beds for acute psychiatric
care are insufficient, as 60% of beds are occupied by
chronic patients, many of whom could be discharged
based on studies (General Secretariat of Mental Health
& Addiction Treatment, 2012; Jenkins et al., 2010).
Across the Arab region, only a few countries,
including Egypt, Qatar, and Palestine, have provided
estimates of mental health expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure, ranging from 1% to
2.5%. For most Arab countries, mental health expenditure is estimated to be less than 1% of total health
expenditure, according to the World Health
Organization (World Health Organization, 2021). This
lack of precise data hinders effective planning for
mental health services.
In Sudan, Yemen, Morocco, Syria, and Lebanon,
out-of-pocket healthcare payments exceed 55%
(Okasha et al., 2012). Private insurance, prevalent in
wealthier countries like the UAE, rarely covers mental
health services, limiting access to care (Alami, 2017).
The healthcare system profiling in the Arab region
restricts the right to health, with financing schemes
primarily tied to formal employment and complex,
inaccessible to rural or informal sector populations
(Alami, 2017).
International and local efforts are concentrated on
addressing the Syrian refugee crisis, currently the
region’s largest, with around two-thirds of Syria’s population fleeing to neighboring Middle Eastern countries like Egypt (Al-Zawawy, 2017).
Mental hospitals predominantly exist in urban
areas, leaving rural regions such as Sinai, Matrouh,
Hurghada, and New Waadi underserved. Rural residents face challenges accessing care due to travel,

lodging expenses, and reliance on traditional healers.
Forensic psychiatric services are centralized, exacerbating access issues for rural populations who often
seek traditional healers before or after medical consultation (Elnemais Fawzy, 2017). Outpatient services,
being hospital-based, pose similar challenges, highlighting the need for outreach programs and
home-based rehabilitation for individuals with severe
mental illness (Jenkins et al., 2010).
In Egypt, where 40% of the population is under
18 years old, 15%–20% of them require mental health
services, but only 5% receive them (World Health
Organization, 2017), indicating a significant gap in
child and adolescent mental health care. Integrating
these services into the national mental health agenda
and enacting legislative and policy reforms, alongside
efforts in training, awareness campaigns, and research,
requires adequate financial allocation. However, economic constraints hinder documentation, evaluation
of resources and outcomes, and participation in international standards, impacting the consistency of practice (El Gabry et al., 2021).
Moreover, there is a pressing need for adequately
trained mental health nurses, social workers, and
occupational therapists, compounded by the absence
of a systematic mechanism for delivering continuing
professional development for mental health and allied
health professionals.
