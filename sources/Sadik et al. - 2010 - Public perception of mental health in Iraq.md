Public perception of mental health in Iraq
Sabah Sadik1†, Marie Bradley2†, Saad Al-Hasoon1†, Rachel Jenkins3*†

Abstract
Background: People who suffer from mental illness, the professionals who treat them, and indeed the actual
concept of mental illness are all stigmatised in public perception and often receive very negative publicity. This
paper looks at Iraq, which has a population of 30 million who are mainly Moslem. Mental health services and
professionals have historically been sparse in Iraq with 1 psychiatrist per 300,000 before 2003 falling to 1 per
million until recently and 1 primary care centre (40 Healthcare Workers including 4 General Practitioners) to 35,000
population, compared with 1 GP per 1700 population in the UK.
Methods: We aimed to assess public attitudes and perceptions to mental illness. Participants were asked to
complete a questionnaire (additional file 1), which was designed specifically for Iraqi contexts and was made
available in 2 languages. The survey was carried out in 500 participants’ homes across 2 districts of Baghdad.
Results: The response rate of the survey was 86.4%. The paper shows respondents views on the aetiology of
mental illness, perceptions of people with mental illness and attitudes towards care and treatment of people with
mental illness.
Conclusions: This survey of public attitudes towards mental illness in Iraq has shown that community opinion
about the aetiology of mental illness is broadly compatible with scientific evidence, but understanding of the
nature of mental illness, its implications for social participation and management remains negative in general.

Background
Across the world, people with mental health problems,
mental health services, mental health professionals and
even the very concept of mental health receive negative
publicity and are stigmatised in public perceptions [1,2],
despite growing evidence of the importance of mental
health for economic, social and human capital. Indeed
the concept of mental capital for countries has recently
been described [1]. Therefore increasing efforts are
being made to challenge this negative publicity and
stigma through anti-stigma campaigns, public education
through schools, and the media etc [3].
Iraq is a Middle Eastern country of 30 Million largely
Moslem population who have lived through extremely
difficult conditions for many years, including physical
privations, political repression and prolonged conflict.
Mental health services in Iraq have historically been
highly centralised in urban areas and hospital based,

with 1 psychiatrist per 300,000 before 2003 falling to 1
per million until recently [4]. General primary health
care services are relatively sparsely distributed, with 1
primary care centre (40 Healthcare Workers including 4
General Practitioners) to 35,000 population, compared
with 1 GP per 1700 population in the UK.
The Iraq Ministry of Health strategy 2009 - 2011 has
put primary care as the central plank of health care provision to the population, with emphases on competence,
leadership, guidelines, standards and effective referral
systems [5]. Mental health is one of the core priorities,
along side maternal care, malnutrition, and noncommunicable diseases.
Mental disorders are of particular concern in Iraq.
A recent national survey found that the estimated lifetime prevalence of any disorder was 18.8% [6]. Cohort
analysis documented significantly increasing lifetime
prevalence of most disorders across generations. This
was most pronounced for panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, with lifetime-to-date prevalence 5.4-5.3 times as high at comparable ages in the
youngest (ages 18-34) as oldest (ages 65+) cohorts.
Anxiety disorders were the most common class of

disorders (13.8%) and major depressive disorder (MDD)
the most common disorder (7.2%). Twelve-month prevalence of any disorder was 13.6%, with 42.1% of cases
classified mild, 36.0% moderate, and 21.9% serious. The
survey also indicated that access to treatment is low
(6.12%) [6].
In 2004 Al-Jawadi found that, 37.4% of children had
mental health disorders (10.5% PTSD, 6% enuresis, and
concluded the importance of mental health education [7].
The aim of the present study is to conduct a baseline
survey of population attitudes towards mental illness in
Iraq, at the start of a project which aimed to improve
public perception of mental health in Iraq through a
dual intervention which comprised education of primary
care staff about mental health, and education of the
public through a media campaign. The project was a
collaboration between the Iraq Ministry of Health and
the International Medical Corporation (a US based
humanitarian NGO working in conflict areas).

study with a randomly selected household as a starting
point and a sampling interval of three. Thus the IMC
interviewers interviewed all adults of both sexes present
that day in every third house or apartment. Children
under 18 were excluded.
The IMC interviewers had received a training session
in the conduct of the interview by one of the authors
(SA). Verbal consent was obtained from each participant, and the information was gathered anonymously.
The IMC interviewer marked the questionnaire in
accordance with the participant’s responses.

Methods
Administrative agreement for the study was obtained
from the Iraq Ministry of Health, and ethics approval
was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the National
Council for Mental Health.
Instruments

The questionnaire to assess public attitudes was developed in Iraq for the Iraqi context (see additional file 1)
and included sections on socioeconomic data, previous
contact with people with mental health problems, aetiology of mental illness, knowledge of people with mental
illness and attitude towards people with mental health
problems, and management of people with mental health
problems. The questionnaire was administered to 30
IMC employees, and then following a discussion session
to discuss the content and format of the questions, their
comments were taken, and the questionnaire amended
accordingly. There are no studies of its reliability.
Answers were recorded on a questionnaire using a
5 point scale (agree, somewhat agree, neutral, somewhat
disagree, disagree). The questionnaire was translated into
Iraqi Arabic, and independently back translated by professional translators.
Sample

The research design was a non- experimental random
field research survey. The survey was conducted in
Baghdad as travel across the rest of the country was difficult for logistic and security reasons. Five districts
from Karkh and five districts from Rasafah were randomly selected to be demographically representative of
the Baghdad population. A systematic random sampling
procedure was used to select the sample units for the

Sample size calculation

The maximum acceptable error for the estimation of
proportions was set to 7% (0.07) and the design effect
was assumed to be 2. The sample was further increased
by 6% to account for contingencies such as nonresponse or data recording error.
Figure 1 shows the statistical formula was used to calculate the sample size for the study, and was calculated
to be 380.

Results
418 questionnaires out of 500 were returned giving a
response rate of 86.4%.
Table 1 shows the socio-demographic breakdown of
the sample. The gender distribution of the respondents
was 225 male (55%) and 193 female (46%) resulting in a
male-female ratio of 1.3:1. The age distribution was
fairly even.
64% were married and 36% were either single, divorced
or widowed, with marital status not recorded for 4 people. The vast majority lived in an urban environment
with only 3.6% living in a rural environment within the
two study districts. 39% of those interviewed either had
no formal education or were educated up to intermediate
level. 61% had attended both secondary and university
level. People were less forthcoming about their income
levels with 10% declining to answer.30% had an income
of less than 200,000ID and 35% with an income of
400,000 to 1 million ID (approximately 1GBP = 1770 ID).
20% of respondents had had some prior contact with
people with mental health problems. The sociodemographic distribution found in the Iraq Census is broadly
similar [8,9].
Table 2 shows respondents’ views on the aetiology of
mental illness. It can be seen that around 60% of
respondents agreed with the statement that mental illness is caused by brain disease. Half of respondents
agreed with the statement that mental illness is caused
by genetic inheritance. And nearly half agreed that substance abuse was the cause of mental illness. On the
other hand, two thirds of respondents considered that
mental illness was caused by something bad happening

to you, while less than a third thought mental illness
was God’s punishment. Nearly two thirds viewed personal weakness as the cause of mental illness.
Tables 3 and 4 shows the respondents’ perceptions and
attitudes of people with mental illness. More than half of
the respondents considered that people with mental illness are capable of work, and two thirds agreed that anyone can suffer from a mental illness. However, four fifths
thought that people with mental health problems are largely to blame for their condition. Over half considered
that people with mental illness are identifiable by their
appearance, and just over half did not think that someone

with a mental illness was capable of true friendships.
Those surveyed were evenly split on whether someone
with a mental illness was usually dangerous.
Around half of respondents thought people with mental illness should not get married, and that people with
mental disorders should not have children while just
under half thought one should avoid all contact with people with mental illness. Just over half thought they could
maintain a friendship with someone who had a mental
illness, but less than one fifth thought they could marry
someone with mental illness. Over half agreed that they
would feel ashamed if a family member had a mental

illness and over half would be afraid to have a conversation with a mentally ill person. While two thirds respondents thought that people with mental illness should
have the same rights as anyone else, around half thought
they would be disturbed about working in the same job
as someone with a mental illness. Three quarters of
respondents would not want people to know if they had
a mental illness but just over half thought people were
generally caring and sympathetic towards those with a
mental illness.
Table 5 shows respondents’ attitudes towards care and
treatment of people with mental illness. Nearly half
thought someone could recover from mental illness and
nearly half of respondents disagreed with the statement
that mental illness cannot be cured, but less than one
fifth agreed that there were mental health services in
their community. Two thirds of respondents thought
that mental illness should not be hidden from their
family. While nearly two thirds agreed with the statement that mentally ill people should be in an institution
under supervision and control, just over two thirds also

agreed that mental illness can be treated outside of a
hospital. Only 15% considered that information about
mental illness is available at their PHC, and only 14%
thought that the PHC could provide good care for mental illnesses, but two thirds did consider they would feel
comfortable discussing a mental health problem with
someone at their PHC.
As described above, the survey participants were asked
about their willingness to form a range of personal relationships with people such as those described in the
vignettes “marry someone with mental illness” (possible
responses ‘yes’ or ‘no’) (see table 4). This information
was then used to calculate a social distance score (see
Table 6) where the minimum possible score was zero,
indicating willingness to engage with the person in the
vignette in all of the defined relationships, and the maximum score was five, indicating unwillingness to engage.
The relationships between the social distance score and
demographic, labelling and causation variables, perceived
dangerousness, and previous contact were investigated.
Greater social distance was significantly associated (P <

person can’t work) which are significantly associated
(P < 0.05) with the social distance score were entered
into a regression model (Table 8). This model showed
that the final significant predictors of social distance
were wanting to hide a mental illness problem from the
family and not wanting to allow a person with mental
illness to take their own decisions even those concerning routine events.

Discussion
The present study is the first systematic survey of attitudes towards people with mental illness in Iraq. Its
design was constrained by the project’s manpower, timeline, cost and security situation in Iraq, and thus the
survey was conducted in Baghdad because of the logistic
and security issues limiting travel, but the socio-demographic characteristics of our sample are representative
of Baghdad and more broadly fairly representative of the
urban Iraqi community, although our sample contained
a higher proportion of university graduates than the
population as a whole [10].
This baseline survey has shown that there is a high
level of contact with people with mental health problems which may reflect a high prevalence of disorder,
poor services or the community’s acceptance of mentally

Page 9 of 11

ill people, or a combination of all three, and warrants
further investigation. Attitudes towards mental illness in
Iraq are very mixed, with large proportions of the population holding stigmatising attitudes towards people with
mental illness in relation to treatment, work, marriage
and recovery. The majority put the blame on the
afflicted individual, avoided contact with them and
would not openly discuss their own psychological
problems.
On the other hand, the population did have a fairly
reasonable understanding of the aetiology of mental illness, citing genetic factors, negative life events, brain
disease and substance abuse as key causes although
God’s punishment and personal weakness were also
viewed as major factors., Understanding of the nature of
mental illness, its implications for social participation
and management remains negative in general. However
the majority accept patients’ rights and the view that
patients can be managed outside hospital, admit that the
services at the PHC level are poor and would welcome
developing such services. Social distance was associated
with higher educational level, wanting to hide a mental
illness problem from the family and not wanting to
allow a person with mental illness to take their own
decisions.
The limitations of our survey are that it only covered
two districts, and did not include rural areas, and that
the questionnaire was not previously tested for validity
and reliability. We are not aware of a similar study in
the Middle East with which to compare these results,
but there are relevant studies in other regions of the
world [11].
Most mental health literacy surveys have been largely
conducted in western countries, with few studies in
developing country contexts. Studies from western
societies have shown that biological factors (diseases of
the brain and genetic factors) and eventual factors
(trauma and stress) are more likely to be considered

causal [12-14], while in Africa, supernatural causes are
widely considered [15-17], and a recent Nigerian survey
found that urban dwelling, higher educational status,
and familiarity with mental illness correlated with belief
in biological and psychosocial causation, while rural
dwelling correlated with belief in supernatural causes.
Adewuya et al 2008 [18], found that urbanicity, educational status, occupational status, age, and familiarity
with mental illness are important independent correlates
of multiple perceived causation of mental illness. A
study in India of community beliefs about causes and
risks for mental disorders, (Kermode et al 2009 [19],
found that the most commonly acknowledged causes
were a range of socio-economic factors, while neither
supernatural causes nor biological explanation were
widely endorsed.
As well as studies on mental health literacy, there have
also been related studies about stigma about mental illness. As with mental health literacy, most research studies of stigma has been conducted in western countries
but there are a small number in low and middle income
countries [20-26]. Culture is likely to influence the
experience, expression, and determinants of stigma and
effectiveness of approaches to stigma reduction.
In India Kermode and colleagues [19], found that the
main predictors of a variable of social distance from
people with mental illness was perceiving the person as
dangerous, while the main predictors of reduced social
distance was being a volunteer health worker, and seeing
the problem as a personal weakness. For depression,
believing the cause to be family tension reduced social
distance. For psychosis, labelling the illness as a mind/
brain problem, a genetic problem or a lack of control
over life increased social distance, and this may be due
to the central importance of marriage in Indian culture.
These findings suggest that promoting explanations
around genetic and other physical causes may not
always help stigma.

Conclusions
Community opinion in Iraq about the aetiology of mental illness is broadly compatible with scientific evidence,
However, understanding of the nature of mental illness,
its implications for social participation and management
remains negative. It is likely to be possible to build on
the existing positive attitudes in the Iraqi population to
enhance social inclusion of people with mental illness.
There is therefore a need for well coordinated public
education and for increased accessibility of effective
mental health care through sustained primary care training, support and supervision about mental health.
