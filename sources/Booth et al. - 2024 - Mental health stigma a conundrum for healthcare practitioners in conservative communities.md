This paper presents perspectives on the stigma and shame around mental
health in conservative communities, and some of the issues faced by health
systems in those communities. The various causes of stigma are explored, and
how these are often more pronounced in culturally reserved, conservative
communities. While health systems are supposed to provide support for mental
health sufferers, this stigma sometimes even extends to healthcare workers,
which can discourage patients from asking for assistance. Solutions and reforms
are needed, for example education programs; addressing gender norms, and
the consideration of culture and religion, to form effective solutions. It is also
suggested that alternative therapies and support mechanisms, including digital
solutions such as artificial intelligence chatbots, may be useful to provide much
needed support to individuals with poor mental health. Along with integrating
options such as CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), it may be useful to draw on
indigenous psychologies, such as Islamic psychology, as a way of decolonizing
approaches. Therefore, when considering solutions, cultural and religious
norms must be considered to ensure their efficacy and acceptance.

Introduction
This paper presents perspectives on the stigma around mental health in conservative
communities, and the association of mental health with shame that is being dealt with by many
health systems around the world. This is particularly apparent within developing countries
and areas where cultural values and practices may influence treatment options. For example,
Elshamy et al. (1) conducted a systematic review of 16 qualitative studies into mental health
seeking behaviors in Middle Eastern countries (typically conservative communities), and they
discovered negative attitudes toward mental health, including stigma and shame. Furthermore,
in a cross-cultural comparison of mental illness stigma and help-seeking attitudes conducted
across 16 Arab countries, Fekih-Romdhane et al. (2) found that out of 10,036 respondents, one
in four held stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health and negative attitudes toward
seeking support.
Encouraging access to mental health support within such conservative communities,
where religion, moral and social identity, and the role of the family take precedence, is often
difficult (3). This is in part because mental health problems are sometimes viewed as shameful
and are, therefore, hidden from friends, family and the workplace (4). Addressing the stigma

around mental health is essential to public health provision because it
can lead to delays in seeking support, which may exacerbate the
condition. In addition, it can have negative consequences not only for
sufferers, but also for their families and caregivers, along with poor
treatment outcomes due to fears over sharing information about
symptoms (5).
A deep understanding of conservative communities and the
persistence of the stigma around mental health is essential to ensuring
the wellbeing of individuals and the functioning of society as a whole.
Therefore, this review of mental health stigma in conservative
communities, and the problems faced by the public and healthcare
practitioners, adds to the knowledge in this area, and it may be useful
in informing future research pathways and findings solutions.
Furthermore, while education and “changing the cultural narrative
around mental health” [(6), p. 1920] is essential, novel approaches are
also needed to directly mitigate the stigma related to mental health
conditions. As we enter into the fourth industrial revolution, new
digital options and technologies such as artificial intelligence may
provide unique solutions.

around PWMI do not always correlate with higher levels of education
(17, 18).

Healthcare systems
Mental health services across conservative communities in the Gulf
region have been receiving increasing support, for example, in Qatar, the
launch of the National Mental Health Strategy for Qatar in 2013 led to
mental health services transitioning toward more community based care
within a more comprehensive and integrated system (19). It is notable that
across the Gulf region during the COVID-19 pandemic, technology was
increasingly used to support mental health sufferers, such as cloud based
big data systems, artificial intelligence and AI chatbots, online health
communities, and telehealth platforms, were introduced as a response to
the pandemic, paving the way for digital mental health solutions.
Therefore, Chew et al. (20) (p. 2) claim that “digital mental health tools are
the silver lining we are fortunate to have, as they can empower responses
to the COVID-19 outbreak at a scale that was never before possible in
human history.”
As expected, the health system is supposed to be a haven for
people with mental healthcare needs, but structurally, the gaps in the
system allow PWMI to fall through the cracks, and for various
reasons, HCWs have been implicated in barriers to access for many
PWMI through their negative attitudes (21). Furthermore, Knaak
et al. (22) explain that stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health
suffers are consistent across the stages of healthcare delivery and
provision. This is a conundrum that requires further analysis, because
in consideration of academic scholarship, and in relation to the
general population, HCWs should set a positive example in matters
relating to mental health. Indeed, we must consider the opposite
argument where there is strong support for HCWs in their capacity as
role models and positive change agents and advocates for PWMI (23).
However, due to the key role of HCWs in ensuring the best possible
care for those who need it, even a singular negative report in this
regard is one too many.
Public stigma is believed to be pervasive and holds the potential
to foster negative mind-sets that build long-lasting views that may
influence important decisions regarding help seeking behaviors (24–
26). However, not only does the stigma around mental health manifest
itself in the general population, and therefore, the friends and relatives
of sufferers, but HCWs are also implicated in the stigma and shaming
of PWMI. This connection is especially significant because these
individuals act as gatekeepers to healthcare access, therefore PWMI
can face an implicit obstacle to accessing the care they need. Moreover,
a health workforce lacking in knowledge or with negatively inclined
practitioners will lead to the creation of an environment that is
unaccommodating for service users. As such, the resulting unfavorable
experiences may discourage the care recipient from asking for
assistance (27).

Culturally based stigma and shame
The definition of stigma proposed by Goffman (7) posits that
stigma is an attribute that devalues a person and sets them aside
from others. This definition lays bare the vulnerability of individuals
with a disability, especially those with mental health needs.
Furthermore, it is well documented in the literature that people
with a mental illness (PWMI) face stigma from multiple sources,
including schools, hospitals, places of worship and sometimes even
from their own families (8, 9). For example, Zolezzi et al. (10) found
that the stigma related to mental health in Arab collectivist societies
extends beyond the sufferer to the whole family, impacting their
reputation; therefore, the stigma and shame around mental health
is exacerbated for PWMI due to concerns about the impact on their
wider family as well as themselves. Similarly, Andrade et al. (11)
explain that in conservative communities where traditional family
values and the notion of “honor” exist, “mental health issues are
more likely to be perceived as threatening the integrity of the family,
given that mental health stigma affects the reputation of the family
involved” [(11), p. 2].
The reasons for these negative attitudes toward mental health have
been shown to have multiple origins that include culture and tradition,
prejudice, and ignorance (12). Although this pattern of behavior is
common in many societies, it is often more pronounced among
culturally reserved, conservative communities (13), where traditional
practices and doctrines have shaped how healthcare workers (HCWs)
receive and relate to their clients. Similarly, it has become common
place in the literature for authors to draw a link between level of
education, mental health literacy and mental health stigma and shame
(10, 12, 14). Based on these associations, it has been suggested that
mental health stigma is less problematic in populations with higher
levels of education or among societies that have high levels of mental
health literacy (15). Therefore, it is plausible that knowledge about
mental health may provide insights into how individuals perceive and
manage mental illness, as well as how the general public interacts with
those who suffer from it (16). Despite this, in reality, positive attitudes

The context of conservative
communities
One may argue that there is a contextual basis for the experiences
around mental health, which may be due to variations in culture and

religion, or purely based on individual differences (22). For instance,
there are those who fervently believe that religious convictions can
solidify attitudes that shape or form views expressed by individuals
(24, 28). In conservative communities, such as some across the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) region, mental health stigma is a
prominent topic of concern. This is due in part to its influence on
access to mental healthcare, as well as its impact on medical practices
in general. Saudi Arabia may be considered as a prime example of one
of these communities.
Situated in the MENA region, Saudi Arabia is predominantly
an Islamic country, and as such, the views and attitudes toward
PWMI and the use of mental healthcare services may have been
shaped by cultural practices and religion (6). Accordingly, a Saudi
hospital-based study suggests that there may be a bias toward
PWMI (29). This can be seen in reports that show that about half
of a sample of specialist doctors held stigmatizing views toward
PWMI (30). This again shows that individuals with higher
education, even among those who are medically trained, may
be involved in the stigmatizing and shaming of people with
mental healthcare needs (10, 29). Regarding this point, Alamri
(29) highlights that in the general population, there is skepticism
about taking part in mental health conversations or accessing
mental health screening programs. This is based on beliefs that
such programs are meant only for people suffering from insanity.
In addition, patriarchy is well engrained in many of these
communities (31), and as documented, men in these settings are
more likely than women to express negative attitudes toward
PWMI, even among HCWs (32). This may influence health
seeking decisions, particularly for women and their children
when they come in contact with a male HCW who may exercise
undue control over a patient-doctor encounter. This again may
have implications for stigma and shame (31). Accordingly,
Awad et al. (4) suggest that psychology solutions should
consider religiosity.
Could it be based on these beliefs and practices that some
HCWs transfer deeply held views about mental illness in their
dealings with those who seek mental health services? Or could it
be based on ignorance or poor mental health education among
HCW? In conservative communities such as Saudi Arabia, multiple
factors may apply, including the diverse background of HCWs,
inadequacies of training and, indeed, the influence of culture (32,
33). However, the bottom line is the overall impact of this on
limiting access to mental healthcare and the potential to drive
PWMI toward the patronage of substandard care (10, 34).

the meantime, alternative therapies and support mechanisms may
be useful to provide much needed support to individuals with poor
mental health.
With regard to the future of mental health, including in
conservative communities, Van Daele et al. (35) state there is a
demand for digital therapy that uses psychological theories and
methods to interface technology with healthcare to support
mental wellness. Furthermore, some have suggested that
technology could serve as a bridge between PWMI and healthcare
staff or therapists by, as the case may be, offering relief and
comfort (35). Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a treatment
that aims to help people modify their thought processes and
behaviors in order to improve their mental health, and its
approaches have been integrated into chatbots for mental health.
Furthermore, Haque (31) suggests embedding indigenous
psychologies to decolonize approaches and ensure culturally
appropriate treatment, including Islamic psychology, which
considers the nature of the human soul, the development of
personality, and the evil eye. This should lead to more rounded
solutions and support that is accepted by the communities in
which it is offered.
It has been shown that conservative communities face a
unique set of problems related to the stigma around mental
health and its persistence. While educating healthcare
professionals and the public is crucial to changing the cultural
narrative, there may also be other alternative approaches that can
provide solutions, especially considering the current speed of
advance in digital technologies. It may also be possible for
religious and cultural norms to be embedded within that
technology. That is, given the multiple challenges plaguing the
healthcare system in conservative communities, the integration
of technology may prove beneficial in enhancing mental health
services, especially for individuals suffering from anxiety and
depression (36). Although there is a dearth of research on
chatbots for mental health in the MENA region, Ujiro et al. (37)
report that there may be some progress, as shown in the use of a
chatbot called OlloBot, which has been used by doctors to help
patients manage their diseases at home and triage patients (37).
With this evidence, it becomes imperative to source alternative
remedies, such as artificial intelligence tools that are less
stigmatizing to PWMI, while attempts are made to improve
attitudes and health systems reform and re-strategize to position
mental healthcare at the heart of the people they serve.

Conclusion

Discussion

It is clear that stigma and shame are a major stumbling block to
accessing mental health services in conservative communities.
Unfortunately, the stigma extends beyond the individual to their
family members, exacerbating the shame they feel. In addition, the
healthcare workers who are expected to support those with mental
health difficulties also sometimes contribute toward the stigma and
feelings of shame, leading to further discouraging patients from
seeking assistance. This situation requires a range of responses to
address the problem within an environment where mental health
problems are on the rise. Such responses should be culturally relevant,

Whatever the root cause of the problem, action to change the
attitudes of the general public toward mental health in conservative
communities, alongside health reforms and training for HCW, is
urgently required. This should include addressing gender norms and
the consideration of culture and religion to form effective solutions.
According to Alattar et al. (6) (p. 192), to change the cultural narrative
around mental illness, “Education and anti-stigma campaigns need to
be developed and further training needs to be developed for mental
health professionals who need to offer greater support in this area.” In
