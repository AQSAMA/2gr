Abstract

Keywords

Despite the global prevalence of mental illness and its negative effects on the economy in
terms of healthcare spending, many affected individuals do not receive timely or adequate
treatment due to stigmatization of such disorders in their communities. Being labeled as
mentally ill can have detrimental consequences in several cultures. In Kuwait, the stigma
associated with visiting the country’s main provider of mental health services, the Psychological
Medicine Hospital, is an obstacle for many seeking professional help for mental health. Cultural
acceptance of visiting the local primary care clinic, however, allows frequent contact with
primary care physicians who often find themselves frustrated at their inability to provide
psychiatric services because it is not part of their training. The refusal of the patient to be
referred to a stigmatized institution further increases the challenges of treating such patients
for these physicians. The integration of mental health care into general health services is a
concept encouraged by the World Health Organization’s 2001 World Health Report and should
be considered in order to overcome this dilemma. Such integrated care would serve as a costeffective solution to facilitating the treatment of these individuals and reducing the stigma
associated with mental disorders through education.

their lack of training in providing such services. Fatima did not
want to visit the Kuwait Psychological Medicine Hospital
because of the effect this would have on her social reputation.
She did not want a visit to the psychiatric hospital documented
in her nationalized health record because she believes this
would label her as mentally ill and that would be detrimental to
many aspects of her life, including her chances of marriage and
acceptance in social circles. To that stigmatized hospital she
will not go, but she is willing to see any of the physicians who
work within the comfortable walls of her primary care clinic.
Unfortunately, in Kuwait, a family physician may be able to
offer Fatima brief counseling and perhaps prescribe an
antidepressant, but he is not trained to provide the basic
behavioral interventions that would help her (Kuwait Institute
for Medical Specialization, 2008). Furthermore, almost half of
physicians working at primary care centers in some governorates are not board-certified family physicians, which means
they lack even the most basic communication and clinical skills
necessary for handling mental health issues (Abdulghafour
et al., 2011). To Fatima, there is no other choice but to suffer in
silence.
The World Health Organization has identified that mental
disorders are among the 20 leading causes of disability
globally (WHO, 2008). The human cost cannot be measured,
but the economic costs are staggering. Economic estimates
from Kuwait are lacking, but US data demonstrates that in

‘‘I know that I need help, but if I go there people will say that
I’m crazy,’’ Fatima mumbled with downcast eyes. Her
primary care physician was helpless. Fatima was clearly
depressed. She was a studious sophomore at Kuwait
University and her grades had slipped recently. She was
having difficulty attending class due to family problems and
had sought help at the nearest place that was easily accessible
as well as socially acceptable to visit: her local primary care
clinic. However, her physician was stuck. After assessing her
symptoms, it was clear that she would probably benefit
from psychiatric evaluation and treatment, but this could
only be found at the Kuwait Psychological Medicine Hospital
(recently rebranded the Kuwait Center for Mental Health).
‘‘I would rather continue suffering than go there,’’ Fatima
asserts. ‘‘Is there no trained doctor here in the family health
clinic who can help me?’’
Fatima’s story is not a unique nor surprising one in Kuwait.
The regrettable answer to her question is that there is no one at
her primary care center who can help her or the many others in
Kuwait who continue to suffer like her. Help can only be found
at a stigmatized facility that everyone avoids, leaving primary
care physicians frustrated at the lack of service integration and

History

2001 the costs of mental health and substance abuse treatment
were $104 billion, which represents 7.6% of total health care
spending (Mark et al., 2005). The task of treating people with
mental illnesses is made even more difficult by the widespread stigma against these individuals in many societies
(Adewuya & Makanjuola, 2008; Lauber & Rössler, 2007;
Lolich & Leiderman, 2008). Furthermore, this stigmatization
has been shown to have a negative economic impact, which
indicates that it must be addressed in order to find a solution
(Sharac et al., 2010).
Although there are no studies showing the extent of this
mental illness stigma in Kuwait, research done in Arab
communities reveals that it may exist at an even higher level
than in Western developed countries (Westbrook et al., 1993).
Studies done in Qatar, a country with a similar cultural
background and population demographic to Kuwait, showed
that fear of people with mental illnesses is common and that
mental disorders are believed to be a result of a punishment
from God or possession by evil spirits (Berner & Ghuloum,
2011; Ghuloum et al., 2010). There is also a tendency for
Arab families who care for a family member with a mental
illness to experience fear, embarrassment, and disgrace of
family reputations leading to feelings of secrecy and isolation
(Dalky, 2012). Both public and self-stigma may negatively
affect patients’ quality of life and influence treatment
outcomes (Corrigan & Watson, 2002). Hence, reforms to
mental health systems must take into account ways to
overcome these forms of stigmas to alleviate the individual
and societal burden of mental illness.
In Kuwait, the cultural background plays a role in directing
people’s preference to self-help or visiting a doctor when
faced with symptoms of mental illness (El-Islam & AbuDagga, 1990). Kuwaitis are accustomed to a neighborhood
structure that is highly cohesive and socialized where the
subdivisions in each of Kuwait’s six governorates are centered
around a major mosque, co-operative society, community
hall, and publicly-funded primary care clinic. Residents often
develop a close relationship with their district’s primary care
physicians, a factor that may lead to improved patient-doctor
relationships and better health care outcomes. In contradistinction, the mental health system in Kuwait is structured
around a single psychiatric hospital that includes 48
psychiatrists, 17 psychologists, 8 social workers, and 294
psychiatric nurses. Psychiatric outpatient clinics also operate
at the five regional hospitals and at other locations such as
prisons and special schools (14 clinics) (WHO, 2001).
However, there is no official collaboration between primary
care and mental health providers in Kuwait. In the US, the
presence of collaborative care between mental health services
and primary care clinics has been shown to result in a faster
and sustained improvement in patients’ mental health status
(Hedrick et al., 2003). Moreover, satisfaction of older adult
patients with mental health services has been reported to be
higher when integrated in primary care settings (Chen et al.,
2006). In Kuwait, where mental disorders such as depression
are prevalent in patients attending primary care centers,
family physicians recognize that primary care is a suitable
place for managing these illnesses and are unsatisfied with the
lack of mental health facilities at these centers (Al-Otaibi
et al., 2007; Ben-nakhi et al., 2008). It becomes of great

importance to consider whether changes in the structure and
delivery of mental health services in Kuwait can be used to
overcome this stigma by relocating them to more socially
acceptable locations.
The World Health Organization’s 2001 World Health
Report recommends shifting care away from large psychiatric
hospitals and the integration of mental healthcare into general
health services. This leads to less stigmatization of staff and
patients, better screening, improved treatment of mental
disorders associated with medical problems, and less costs
due to the shared infrastructure (WHO, 2001). Collaborative
care models in which mental health professionals are
integrated within primary healthcare have also been shown
to be preferred by primary care clinicians due to improved
communication between mental health providers and primary
care physicians, coordinated care of mental and physical
health, and less stigma towards patients with mental disorders
(Gallo et al., 2004). Although there is no single best practice
model for all countries to follow, the World Health
Organization states the integration should include training
of primary care workers, the presence of a mental health
service coordinator, the availability of specialist mental health
facilities and professionals, and access to basic psychiatric
medication in primary care (WHO/Wonca, 2008). An
integrated community-based mental health service would
then be able to decrease the treatment gap for mental
disorders and generate good health outcomes in an affordable
and cost-effective manner (Chisholm, 2005).
It is important to recognize the possible barriers to creating
integrated mental health services in Kuwait’s primary care
centers and the probable challenges that will arise with this
change. The issue of stigma itself may make it difficult to
accept the resulting proximity of individuals being treated for
mental illnesses as it has been shown that people prefer that
facilities for psychiatric care be located away from the
community (Al-Adawi et al., 2002). Physicians must use this
opportunity to educate community members about mental
illnesses and encourage the utilization of mental health
services. Another difficulty would be the need for additional
training of primary care physicians to enable them to followup patients with mental disorders properly and the necessity
of clear protocols to clarify their role in management. Other
than psychiatrists, primary care centers might also require
psychologists to treat mild mental illnesses using behavioral
therapies. This, along with making psychiatric medication
available at these centers, involves administrative decisions
that may be slow to achieve considering the prevalent
bureaucracy in Kuwait’s ministries. Once the integration of
mental health services is achieved, there will be a need for a
national campaign to spread awareness about these services to
both physicians and the community. This may prove to be a
challenge if the collaborative care model lacks support from
either the primary care physicians or the healthcare
authorities. Therefore, it is crucial for health policy makers
to promote education in parallel to this integration and ensure
the administrative and financial support of the Ministry of
Health.
Kuwait’s healthcare system includes trained mental health
professionals and primary care clinics that are readily
frequented by people who suffer from mental illnesses.

Until reforms are made to integrate these two services,
the shame of visiting the Psychological Medicine Hospital
will continue to prevent patients like Fatima from
finding compassion and competent care. By providing
mental health services at the primary healthcare level, many
patients will be able to get the treatment they need with
minimal stigma, and this would provide an excellent
opportunity for health professionals to erase this stigma,
once and for all, through education. Only then will the
silence of suffering be broken across this invisible barrier of
shame.
Since the original submission of this editorial a dynamic
new leadership team at the Kuwait Center for Mental Health
(formerly the Kuwait Psychological Medicine Hospital), has
announced a plan to begin shared-care clinics between
psychiatrists and family doctors in a pilot program at 5 of
the countries community health centers. This a recent
commendable step that the authors applaud and encourage.
The road towards a fully integrated system as we describe in
this writing remains long, but Kuwait is a few steps closer due
to these recent efforts.
